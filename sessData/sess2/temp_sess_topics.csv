Bennett’s [16] helpful discussion of OBA regulation

from  ongoing  FTC  public  hearings  that  result  in 
recommendations to the industry, which responds by 
developing and adjusting its self-regulatory codes. 

Hoofnagle  et  al.  [12]  argue  that  advertisers  use

industry  claims  that  OBA  is  advantageous  because 
people  want  personalization  and  customization. 
However, Turow [17] says that since the industry—
not 
the  consumer—is  making  decisions  about 
customization,  consumer  “control”  is  a  façade.  This 
type of information asymmetry between a consumer 
and a company puts the consumer at a disadvantage 
[18,  19].  Americans  are  concerned  about  data 
privacy. The 2016 U.S. Consumer Privacy Index [20] 
found 92% of Internet users are worried about online 
privacy, and 74% said they limited online activity in 
the past year because of their concerns.

1.  Introduction  
 

The  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  has 
raised  concerns  in  recent  years  about  how  online 
behavioral  advertising 
(OBA)  practices  affect 
consumers’ privacy in the mobile environment [1, 2]. 
OBA, the practice of sending consumers targeted ads 
based  on  data  collected  by  tracking  their  online 
activities over time, is now occurring across devices. 
The  online  advertising  industry  is  largely  self-
regulated, but has adjusted its self-regulatory codes in 
response to privacy concerns raised by the FTC  [3–
7].  This  study  examined  new  tools  created  for  the 
mobile environment as part of the industry’s notice-
and-choice  model,  in  which  consumers  are  notified 
behaviorally-targeted  advertising  may  be  occurring 
and offered preference-adjusting tools. 

Previous  studies  have  found  major  usability 
problems with the notice-and-choice model [8, 9]. It 
has  been  widely  criticized  by  consumer  advocacy

and children’s data, OBA is subject to industry self-
regulation with limited federal oversight. The FTC, in 
its  consumer  protection  role,  has  given  guidance  to 
the  Internet  advertising  industry  based  on  public 
hearings [2, 21, 22] and investigates complaints. The 
industry  has  been  responsive  in  hopes  of  avoiding 
formal legislation.  

its  focus  on 

The  Digital  Advertising  Alliance  (DAA)  is  the 
overarching  self-regulatory  organization  for  online 
advertising  in  the  U.S.  The  Network  Advertising 
Initiative  (NAI),  with 
third-party 
advertisers,  has  also  been  integral  in  developing  the 
framework. The DAA augmented its 2009 principles 
[23]  with  three  documents  that  advise  members  on 
the  use  of  multi-site  data  in  2011  [24],  the  mobile 
environment in 2013 [3], and cross-device data use in 
2015  [4].  The  NAI  updated  its  2008  self-regulatory 
code of conduct [25] in 2013 [26] and 2015 [5].  

The DAA and NAI codes require giving notice of 
data  collection  on  website  privacy  policies.  Many 
studies  have  shown  to  these  policies  to  be  overly 
complex, tedious and rarely read [27–30], especially 
in the mobile environment [31]. Furthermore, though 
they  address  cookie-based  tracking,  they  have  only 
recently  begun  to  address  other  forms  of  tracking 
technologies [12], [32–35]. The NAI issued guidance 
for  non-cookie  technology  in  2015  [7];  the  DAA 
began to address this in April 2017 [36]. 

The codes also require offering consumers choice 
to  opt  out  of  (or  into,  depending  on  information 
sensitivity) 
receiving  behaviorally-targeted  ads. 
However,  even  if  a  consumer  chooses  to  opt  out  of 
receiving  “interest-based  ads,”  (the  industry’s  term), 
it does not mean tracking of the consumer will cease.  
Besides privacy policies, the OBA disclosure was 
developed  by  the  industry  as  a  means  of  notifying 
consumers about behaviorally-targeted ads. It usually 
consists  of  an  icon,  a  tagline,  or  both,  shown  on  or 
near  an  online  ad.  Not  all  behaviorally-targeted  ads 
show the disclosure. The icon is very small, typically 
about 10-20 pixels square. Different icons have been 
used,  but  the  most  prevalent  is  the  Advertising 
 created as part of the 
Options, or AdChoices, icon 
DAA  and  NAI  self-regulatory 
frameworks.  A 
disclosure  typically  links  to  information  from  the 
entity placing the ad that explains OBA and offers an 
opt-out. Such opt-outs apply only to that company’s 
ads  and  are  specific  to  the  browser  and  computer 
being  used.  Opt-outs  are  set  by  placing  third-party 
cookies on a user’s browser; if cookies are cleared, so 
are the opt-outs.  

Curiously,  the  DAA  employs  three  different 
websites  as  part  of  its  self-regulatory  program: 
youradchoices.com, 
digitaladvertisingalliance.org, 
and  www.aboutads.info,  which  is  where  the  web-

 

the  mobile  webpage 

based opt-out tool can be found. During our usability 
testing, 
listed  119-126 
participating  companies;  for  the  app,  there  were 
consistently  32.  The  NAI 
lists  105  member 
companies,  84  of  which  are  also  DAA  member 
companies. It has one website, where its opt-out tool 
resides: www.networkadvertising.org/choices.  

Privacy  advocates  continually  raise  concerns 
about OBA practices, and researchers have found the 
industry’s  self-regulation  measures  to  be  ineffective 
[8–10],  [37]  and  inadequate  in  protecting  consumer 
privacy [38, 39]. Many academic studies have found 
consumers to have limited understanding of OBA and 
how they can opt out of receiving it [8, 28, 40]. Even 
for  those  who  do,  opting  out  of  OBA  does  not 
necessarily  mean  they  can  stop  online  surveillance 
and  profiling  occurring  through  the  industry’s  data 
collection practices, which are of greater concern and 
consequence to consumer privacy [13].  

The  advertising 

industry’s  notice-and-choice 
model  presumes  consumers  will  1)  notice  a 
disclosure, 2) know what it is, 3) know how/be able 
to click it 4) understand the information provided on 
linked  pages,  and  5)  figure  out  how  the  opt-out 
mechanism  works.  Even  then,  users  may  think  they 
are  making  universal  and  permanent  changes,  when 
they  may  only  apply  to  that  site,  temporarily.  Also, 
visual presentation of opt-out information is not at all 
uniform;  it  varies  widely  from  site  to  site,  as 
evidenced in this study. 
2.2.  Efficacy of OBA choice mechanisms  
 

 

Several  academic  studies  have  shown 

the 
industry’s  self-regulation  efforts  to  be  ineffective  at 
meaningfully  addressing  consumer  privacy.  Cranor 
[37]  studied  what  users  understand  about  OBA, 
disclosures,  and  online  privacy  tools.  She  and  her 
students  found  that  participants  generally  lacked 
awareness  about  how  it  works  and  what  tools  were 
available to control preferences. They also evaluated 
several  opt-out  tools  and  found  that  none  of  them 
enabled  users  to  effectively  implement  their  desired 
tracking  preferences.  Hastak  &  Culnan  [9]  analyzed 
the  communication  efficacy  of  OBA  disclosures. 
They  found  that  some  taglines  worked  better  in 
conveying  the  purpose  and  “clickability”  of  the 
disclosures  than  others,  however,  they  were  not  the 
ones being most widely used (e.g., AdChoices). Leon 
et  al.  [40]  followed  up  with  an  online  study  to  test 
OBA 
pages. 
“AdChoices,”  the  most  frequently  used  tagline  in 
disclosures, was one of the least effective. Users were 
afraid  to  click  it  and  were  confused  about  the 
meaning  of  opt-out.  Ur  et  al.  [41]  interviewed  non-

taglines, 

landing 

icons, 

and 

Page3780 

technical  Internet  users  about  their  attitudes  toward 
OBA.  They  found  that  users  misinterpreted  icons  in 
third-party ad disclosures and did not understand the 
role of third-party ad networks. Yao et al. [42] did a 
qualitative study that featured interviews, a card sort 
and  a  drawing  task  to  try  to  better  understand 
people’s mental models about OBA. They found four 
broad  “folk  models,”  all  either 
inaccurate  or 
incomplete in representing actual OBA practices. 
2.3.  Users’ understanding of privacy in the 

 

mobile environment 

the 

Because 

industry’s  application  of  self-
regulatory principles to the mobile environment is so 
recent,  little  research  has  been  conducted  on  its 
implementation.  Wobbrock  [43]  discussed  usability 
and accessibility challenges of mobile devices due to 
smaller  screen,  font  and  button  sizes;  limited  and 
varying input affordances; and varying use contexts. 
More  specifically,  King  and  Jessen  [38]  explored 
personalization  and  localization  privacy  concerns 
that arise when consumers are targeted in the mobile 
environment.  Mobile  devices  tend  to  only  have  one 
user,  unlike  desktop  devices,  so  their  data  is  more 
likely  to  be  linked  to  an  individual.  Localization 
refers to the use of precise geographic location data 
possible with mobile devices. 

information  on  mobile  devices 

Singh  et  al.  [31]  tested  the  readability  and 
comprehension  of  privacy  policies  in  a  mobile 
environment. They concluded that text-based privacy 
policies  would  never  be  effective  in  communicating 
privacy 
and 
recommended simpler, graphical methods. Lin et al. 
[44]  compared  users’  expectations  of  what  sensitive 
information an app accesses and why, with what the 
app actually does. They found participants felt more 
comfortable  when  informed  why  a  resource  was 
requesting  access  for  sensitive 
like 
unique  device  ID,  contact  list,  network  location  and 
GPS  location.  They  concluded  that  informing  users 
of  sensitive  resource  access  without  explanation  did 
not adequately inform their decision-making.  
2.4.  Evaluating AdChoices icon usability 
 

information 

The usability of the AdChoices icon in the mobile 
environment will be mapped out using Schaub et al.’s 
privacy  notice  design  space, 
then  analyzed  by 
applying Norman’s interaction design principles.  

Schaub  et  al.  [45]  developed  a  useful  taxonomy 
for evaluating types of privacy notice designs based 
in literature and on expert feedback. They described 
an  effective  privacy  notice  design  space  in  terms  of 
four  dimensions:  timing,  channel,  modality  and 

 

 

 

is  active)  or  on-demand 

control. Timing addresses when a notice is provided: 
it  can  be  at  setup  (helps  users  decide  if  tradeoff  is 
acceptable),  just-in-time  (when  data  collection  is 
happening),  context-dependent  (information  based 
context of user or system), periodic (how frequently 
notice  occurs),  persistent  (ongoing  notice  when 
practice 
(user  seeks 
information).  The  notice’s  channel  can  be  primary 
(on the same platform with which the user interacts), 
secondary  (notice  is  provided  elsewhere  if  system 
does not afford ability to deliver the primary notice) 
or public (notice does not target a particular user. A 
privacy  notice’s  modality  describes  its  interaction 
modes: visual, auditory, haptic or machine-readable. 
Control relates to how choices are provided to a user. 
A blocking notice interrupts the user’s action; a user 
must  interact  with  it  in  order  to  continue.  Non-
blocking  notices  are  less  obtrusive  and  do  not  deter 
action. Decoupled notices provide privacy controls in 
a different location than the notice itself. 

Norman  [46]  outlined  seven  well-established 
interaction  design  principles 
that  can  affect  a 
system’s usability. Discoverability means a user can 
easily  figure  out  what  something  can  do  and  what 
state  the  system  is  in.  Feedback  is  information  a 
device gives a user about the results of actions taken 
or its current state. A good conceptual model helps a 
user understand how a system actually works, which 
can 
are 
possibilities for interaction between user and device. 
Signifiers communicate how to use a design through 
affordances,  feedback,  and  constraints.  Mapping  is 
the  logical  relationship  between  controls  and  their 
actions.  And  constraints  limit  possible  actions,  and 
can be physical, logical, semantic, and/or cultural.

3.  Methodology  

 
The  IRB-approved  study  consisted  of  an  entry 
questionnaire,  a  usability  test  that  employed  three 
tasks corresponding to each of the DAA tools for the 
mobile environment, and an exit questionnaire. This

Study participants (n=18) were recruited by email 
and  word  of  mouth.  The  convenience  sample 
included students from two area universities, as well 
as university foundation co-workers of the one of the 
researchers.  Sessions  were  conducted  in  all  three 
places  convenient  for  the  participants  and  lasted 
approximately one hour.  

While the small sample is not generalizable, there 
were more than enough participants to identify major 
usability  issues.  Nielsen  [47]  found  that  testing  five

users is typically sufficient to discover most usability 
problems  with  a  design,  and  that  15  users  can  find 
nearly all the problems. Lewis [48] said that 94% of 
problems  can  be  found  with  four  participants  in 
problem discovery usability studies.  

the  usability 

This  study  is  unique  in  that  it  employed  actual 
phones,  rather  than  simulations,  to  enhance  the 
ecological  validity  of 
testing. 
Participants  were  given  an  iPhone  or  Android  test 
smartphone  according  to  the  model  they  currently 
owned. Their activity was recorded on-screen and by 
videotaping their hands using the phones, to which all 
participants  consented.  For  iPhone  users,  the  screen 
of 
recorded  using 
QuickTime.  Android  users’  activities  were  recorded 
on-screen using the AZ Screen Recorder app, which, 
unlike  QuickTime,  could  be  configured  to  show 
where the participant was touching the screen.

After  completing  an  online  entry  questionnaire, 
participants  were  asked  to  complete  three  usability 
tasks  that  corresponded  to  each  of  the  three  Digital 
Advertising  Alliance 
the 
AdChoices icon, Consumer Choice Page for Mobile 
Web  and  the  AppChoices  mobile  app.  They  were 
asked to think aloud as they went through the tasks. 
Versions  of  the  usability  script  were  created  for 
Android and iPhone. Both test phones were restored 
to factory default settings.  

tools  being 

tested: 

iPhone  users  were  given  an  iPhone  5S  running 
iOS  9.1  restored  to  factory  settings  between  each 
participant.  Safari  Privacy  &  Security  settings  were 
configured with Do not track toggled to off and Block 
cookies set to Allow from websites I visit (third-party 
cookies blocked by default). Before each task, Safari 
browser cookies were cleared then checked, and the 
advertising 
identifier  reset.  Default  settings  for 
iPhone 5S also include Limit Ad Tracking set to off. 

Android  users  were  given  a  Kyocera  Hydro  Air 
(C6745) running Android version 5.1.1 (Lollipop). It 
was also reset to factory defaults between each task. 
Chrome  browsing  data  was  cleared  in  its  privacy 
settings,  then  all  running  apps  cleared  using  the 
Recents button (☐). In the phone’s settings, all apps 
were closed and memory reset in Usage manager. In 
Settings  >  Apps,  the  action  overflow  icon  (⋮)  was 
used  to  Reset  app  preferences.  Also  within  Apps 
settings, under both  Chrome  and AppChoices, Clear 
data,  clear  cache,  force  stop  were  run. Recents  was 
used again to clear all running apps. The final Apps 
settings  adjustment  was  in  Google  Settings  >  Ads, 
where the advertising ID was reset. Then all running 
apps were cleared again. 

 

One  significant  difference  in  privacy  defaults 
between  the  iOS  and  Android  operating  systems  is 
that  Safari  defaults  to  block  third-party  cookies, 
while Chrome defaults to accept them. This impacted 
the  usability  test  Task  1  for  the  AdChoices  icon, 
which  will  be  explained  in  greater  detail  in  the 
Results  section.  Chrome  default  Privacy  settings 
included Safe browsing turned on and Do Not Track 
set  to  off.  In  Site  Settings,  pop-ups  default  to  being 
blocked.  Finally,  the  toggle  for  opting  out  of 
receiving interest-based ads on the Android phone is 
set to off (so users will receive them by default). 

Based  on  the  Leon  et  al.  study  [40],  participants 
were  given  the  smartphone  with  the  homepage  of  a 
news website active for the first usability task. They 
were asked to locate the AdChoices icon, then asked 
what  they  thought  it  meant  before  tapping  on  it. 
Depending  on  what  happened  when  they  tapped  it, 
some participants were asked what they thought any 
options  that  may  have  appeared  meant.  Then  they 
were asked to find where to adjust their ad preference 
settings  and  opt  out  of  receiving  interest-based  ads. 
That  concluded  Task  1,  and  the  participant  returned 
the smartphone to be set up for subsequent tasks. 

After the usability test, participants completed an 
exit  questionnaire,  were  debriefed  and  compensated 
$10 for their time, then offered a list of informational 
resources about behavioral targeting and tracking. 
 
4.  Results 

 
Participants 

(n=18)  were 

smartphone  users 
ranging  in  age  from  18-49.  There  were  ten  females 
and  eight  males,  and  education  levels  ranged  from 
some  college  to  graduate  degrees.  All  participants 
consented  to  participate  in  the  study  and  have  it 
recorded.  Nine  participants  were  Android  users, 
running operating systems ranging from 4.44 to 6.0, 
which was the current operating system at the time of 
the study. Nine of the participants were iPhone users, 
running  versions  of  iOS  between  7.1.2  and  9.3.1, 
which was the latest version at the time. This roughly 
reflected  the  breakdown  of  platform  market  share 
among U.S. smartphone subscribers at the time of the 
study  (52.7%  Android  and  43.9%  Apple),  though 
iPhones were slightly overrepresented in the sample.

AdChoices  icon  and  asked  to  find  it  on  a  mobile 
news webpage. All but two were given the homepage 
of a local newspaper’s website to search for the icon. 
The  remaining  two  were  given  a  local  TV  station’s 
news homepage because there were not any ads with 
icons  on  the  newspaper’s  homepage  at  the  time  of 
their testing session. Before giving participants a test 

Participants  were  shown  an

least one icon on the page. 
4.1.  Time to find icon 

 

Typically there were 7-8 display ads on the news 
site’s  homepage,  which  was  long  for  scrolling  on  a
smartphone. Half of the participants (n=9) made it to 
the  bottom  of  the  page  at  least  once  before  finding 
the  icon.  Six  participants  gave  up  before  finding  it, 
and  the  researcher  assisted  by  first  confirming  there 
was  still  an  icon,  and  when  necessary,  informing 
them it was on the screen.  

On average it took participants 1 min 6 sec to find 
the  icon;  search  times  ranged  from  1 sec  to  4 min 
7 sec.  Two  participants  accidentally  reloaded  the 
page. In one case, the page reload resulted in there no 
longer  being  an  ad  with  the  icon  on  the  page.  The
participant gave up 3 min 24 sec into the task, when
the  researcher  looked  at  the  phone  and  confirmed 
there was no icon present, then clicked into one of the 
story pages and found two more before returning the 
phone  with  an  icon  showing;  the  participant  saw  it 
within  seconds.  This  case  resulted  in  the  longest 
search time of 4 min 7 sec; the next longest time was 
2  min  53  sec.  A  third  participant  had  page  load 
problems as a result of a network connectivity error. 
 
Icon visibility: size, position, state, color 
4.2. 
According to the DAA’s 2013 creative guidelines 
[49] for the icon and ad marker, the icon should be no 
smaller  than  12x12  pixels  with  10-px  type  (9.5 
points).

recommends  a  tap  area  around  the  marker  that  is 
between 20x20 and 40x40 pixels.

Its  mobile  ad  marker  guidance 

It  is  challenging  to  compare  pixel  sizes  with 
different  devices.  The  size  of  pixels  is  relative  to  a 
screen’s  size  and  resolution,  so  the  physical  size  of 
the icon varies depending on the pixel density of the 
device  on  which  it  appears.  In  the  case  of  the  test 
phones  used  in  this  study,  the  iPhone  5’s  pixel 
density  is  higher  (326  ppi)  than  that  of  the  Kyocera 
phone  (220  ppi),  because  it  has  a  higher  resolution 
(640x1136  pixels)  on  a  smaller  screen  (4"").  The 
Kyocera  phone  has  a  540x960-pixel  resolution  on  a 
5""  screen.  Icons  appearing  on  the  test  iPhone 
averaged 23x23 pixels, while those appearing on the
test  Kyocera  phone  averaged  20x20  pixels.  The 
computer  was  a  13""  MacBook  Air,  which  had  a 
1440x900-pixel  resolution  and  a  131-ppi  density, 
displayed icons at around 15x15 pixels. See Figure 1 
for a comparison, and Figures 2-4 for physical size. 

Several  participants  commented  on  the  icon’s 
size.  One  mentioned  how  small  it  was  and  that  it

another  participant  commented,  “It’s  really  small

picture,”  pointing  to  the  image  on  the  instruction 
sheet.  Other  responses  were  more  colorful.  One 
exasperated  participant  said,  “Oh  my  God,  am  I 
blind?”  and  described  the  icon  as  “miniscule”  upon 
finding  it.  Another  participant,  who  finally  spotted 
the  icon  after  searching  for  3  minutes  35  seconds, 
exclaimed, “Holy s---! I’m supposed to see that? That 
might as well not even be there!” 

In  addition 

tiny  size,  another  factor 
contributing to the obscurity of the icon on the page 
was  its  potential  state  change:  sometimes  the  icon 
alternated  to  an  “X”.  The  DAA’s  mobile  ad  marker 
guidance  [50]  recommends  including  a  persistent 
close  mechanism  in  the  top  right  corner  in  keeping 
with  user  convention.  It  even  suggests  that  the  ad 
marker be placed in a different corner, and makes no
mention of the animation we encountered. 

left  and  one  was 

In total, participants passed the icon 16 times and 
the X 12 times. Participants passed a state change six 
times.  Of  the  19  icons  participants  found,  nearly  all 
were  in  the  top  right  corner  of  the  ad  (n=16);  two 
were  bottom 
left.  One 
participant had to find a second icon, which will be 
explained  later.  Ten  of  the  found  icons  alternated 
with  an  X  in  the  right  corner.  One  was static in  the 
top  left  corner.  Three  ads  showed  the  icon  and  X
side-by-side  with  no  animation;  two  sets  in  the  top 
right corner, one set bottom left. In one case, the ad 
itself being animated affected the functionality of the 
icon link: a participant tried tapping the icon as the ad 
was  morphing  to  another  image  and  it  didn’t  work. 
She tried again after it stopped and was successful.  

The  icon’s  colors  and  transparency  may  also 
contribute to its lack of visibility. DAA’s ad marker 
guidelines specify an icon color palette consisting of 
a cyan blue (HEX: #00AECD) for the symbol, which 
can  be  used  at  30-100%  transparency,  on  a  field  of 
20% grey (#CCCCCC), which can be shown at a 60-
90%  transparency.  These  HEX  values  were  entered 
into  the  WebAIM  color  contrast  checker  website 
[51]. The contrast ratio was 1.65:1—at full opacity—
which  fails  WCAG  2.0  guidelines  for  contrast  ratio

requirements for both normal and large sized text at 
Level AA (4.5:1 for normal sized text; 3:1 for large) 
and Level AAA (7:1 for normal text; 4.5:1 for large). 
Any additional transparency would further reduce the 
contrast.  Though the  icon  is  not  text,  this  helps  us 
understand factors that may impact icon legibility. Its
size,  position  within  the  ad,  state,  and  color  can  all 
adversely affect its propensity for being noticed. 
 
4.3. 

Icon functionality 

Once participants found the icon, they were asked 
what they thought it would lead to. Of 16 participants 
who  answered  before  tapping  the  icon,  13  (81%) 
thought  it  would  lead  to  the  ad,  the  advertised  web 
page, or more ads. Two participants thought it might 
lead to information about the ad or why it was there. 
Another  answered,  “AdChoices  company  website; 
maybe show you a privacy policy or something.” One 
thought it would lead to ad settings.  

Two  participants  mentioned  the  X.  One  thought 
tapping  it  would  close  the  ad  (it  did  not).  Another
suggested it was deceptive, in that advertisers may be 
trying to trick users into thinking they can close the 
ad, but clicking the X would actually take them to the 
ad (also incorrect). In this study we found tapping the 
X triggered the same action as tapping the icon.  

tapping 

icon  brought  up 

Two  participants  tapped  the  icon  before  the 
researcher could ask where they thought it led. In one 
case, 
the  phrase 
AdChoices.  When  asked  what  it  would  lead  to,  the 
participant  said,  “Because  it  says  AdChoices,  and 
based  on  my  instructions,  I  would  assume  to  goes 
into some kind of privacy control settings.” This was 
the only participant who mentioned privacy settings. 
[49]
recommend four use cases for what might happen on 
tapping  the  icon:  1)  link  to  publisher’s  choice 
mechanism or device instructions, 2) open interstitial 
inside  the  ad,  3)  display  additional  text  next  to  the 
icon, or 4) expand the ad with interstitial. Of the 19 
ads with found icons, 14 opened an interstitial inside 
the ad containing additional links when first tapped. 

DAA’s  mobile  ad  marker  guidelines 

the 

Of those, 13 gave links to three options: AdChoices, 
Ad  covers  the  page,  and  Report  this  ad.  The 
remaining  interstitial  included  a  Citi  logo  and  the 
phrase “Tap to edit advertising preferences” under an 
X.  The  remaining  five  ads  triggered  the  phrase 
“AdChoices” to appear next to the icon.  

Eighteen  ads  had  an  AdChoices  link,  most  of 
which led to Google’s AdSense Help: About Google 
Ads  page  (n=16)  on  the  second  tap.  One  led  to  a 
Rocket  Fuel  opt-out  page,  and  one  led  to  Ghostery 
opt-out page (which had an Evidon URL and offered 
one opt-out for Google’s DoubleClick ad network).  

The Citi ad yielded an unusual result and was the 
reason an additional ad was selected during this task. 
Rather  than  linking  to  web-based  information  or  an 
opt-out, the “Tap to edit advertising preferences” link 
launched  iPhone’s  AppStore and  brought  up  the 
AppChoices  app.  This  was  strange,  because  the  app
uses the phone’s ad identifier number to set opt-outs, 
not cookies like the webpage does. This could easily
obscure a user’s mental model of how opt-outs work.  
We tried to find another icon on the page, but the 
only other one was on another Citi ad, which also led 
to  AppStore.  The  participant  had  trouble  activating 
the link: tapping the icon took her to the advertiser’s
page. She backed up to the homepage, zoomed in on 
the ad to make the icon larger, tried again, and was 
taken to the AppStore. We then went into one of the 
story  pages, and  we  were  able  to  find  another  icon. 
This ad it was on was used for the remainder of Task 
1, and is the reason why there was an extra ad. 

Other participants also had trouble activating the 
icon’s  link.  Tapping  as  the  ad  was  animating  or 
tapping the wrong area caused problems. Some taps 
brought  up  interstitials,  or  went  to  the  ad’s  website.
Even  when  a  first  tap  triggered  the  AdChoices  text, 
some had trouble activating the link with a second tap 
of  the  icon.  Zooming  in  to  maximum  view  did  not 
help.  In  one  case,  the  researcher  suggested  tapping 
the words, which did activate the link.  

On one occasion the icon’s tap area collided with 
the tap areas of both the ad itself and the webpage’s 
back-to-top  arrow.  Zooming  in,  a  participant  clearly

After 
rapidly 
scrolling  back  down 
again and tapping the 
icon,  only  to  activate  the  back-to-top  button  again, 
the  participant  exclaimed,  “No!”  The  researcher 
suggested looking for other icons on the page, which 
the  participant  did,  but  there  were  none.  She  then 
suggested  that  turning  the  phone  to  a  horizontal 
orientation might put the icon in a different position 
on  screen.  This  worked:  the  participant  scrolled 
down,  zoomed  in,  and  tapped  the  center  of  the  icon 
again.  The  AdChoices  interstitial  appeared.  This 
process took 1 minute 49 seconds. 
4.4.  Adjusting preferences 

 

Once participants tapped the AdChoices link and 
arrived at a page that offered them information about 
opting  out,  it  took  them  1  minute  28  seconds  on 
average to figure out how to adjust their preferences 
(min=20  sec,  max=3  min  29  sec).  As  previously 
mentioned,  most  (n=16)  were  taken  to  the  Google 
AdSense Help page, which does not contain an opt-
out mechanism. Users must tap an “Ad Settings” link 
about  halfway  down  the  page  to  reach  the  opt-out, 
which  is  on  a  different  page.  This  link  is  in  a  table 
under the heading “How you can manage the ads you 
see,” after about 329 words of copy. An anchor link 
farther up the page under the second section heading 
can take a user down to the table containing the Ad 
Settings link. Five participants tapped this link before 
tapping  the  Ad  Settings  link.  The  remaining  11 
scrolled down to it. One gave up before reading the 
page; the researcher asked him to keep trying.  

Once  participants  tapped  the  Ad  Settings  link, 
they  were  taken  to  the  “Control  your  Google  ads” 
page, which contained the opt-out mechanism. They 
were  asked  to  opt  out.  This  page  had  two  toggle 
switches that could be used to adjust preferences for
interest-based ads: the first was for websites beyond 
google.com, the second for Google search ads. There 
was  a  difference  in  the  default  setting  on  this  page 
between  Android  and  iOS.  On  the  Android  phone, 

both  switches  defaulted  to  ON  and  were  green, 
corresponding  with  a  section  below  that  explained 
what ON meant. The word ON was green, to the right 
of the switch, and the word OFF was not present. On 
the  iPhone,  the  first  switch  defaulted  to  a  neutral 
middle position (Figure 6). The switch was gold, the 
word ON was to the right, OFF was to the left, and 
both  were  grey.  In  the  gold  field  above  the  first 
switch, users were asked to set their preferences. The 
second  switch  defaulted  to  ON.  Like  the  Android 
phone, the switch and word ON were green; the word 
OFF  was  not  shown.  For  both  platforms,  once  the 
switch was turned off, it turned grey and showed the 
grey  word  OFF  to  the  right.  The  word  ON  did  not 
appear. Five of 16 participants who encountered this 
page did not scroll down far enough to see the second 
switch, but the first was consistent with the pattern. 

Several  participants  had  problems  with  these 
switches.  The  toggle  switch  (Figure  6)  elicited  a 
swiping  motion 
for  six 
participants.  The  other  10 
tapped the switch and were 
only  successful  part  of  the 
time. For some, tapping the 
switch  turned  it  on  at  first, 
then they had to tap again to 
turn  it  off.  Others  figured 
out they had to tap the word 
to  either  side  of  the  switch 
to make it function. 

Two  participants  were 
taken  to  a  page  other  than 
Google.  One  link  led  to  a 
RocketFuel  privacy  policy 
webpage,  which  offered  an 
opt-out 
link  after  1,689 
words  of  copy.  Once  the 
participant  found  the  link, 
which said “click here,” and 
tapped it, she was opted out 
immediately  and  returned  to  the  top  of  the  page, 
where a confirmation message appeared. 

Figure	6:	iPhone	toggle	
switch	on	Google	ads	

preferences	page	

The  simplest  mechanism  we  encountered  in  this 
study was a Ghostery Enterprises (now Evidon) page. 
It had the shortest, clearest message about opting out 
preceding its mechanism on the same page: 

How	Data	Powers	Your	Experience	
You	can	opt	out	of	any	or	all	of	the	companies	listed	
below.	 Opting	 out	 does	 not	 mean	 you	 will	 stop	
seeing	ads.	It	means	that	the	company	you	opt	out	
of	will	no	longer	use	your	data	to	target	ads	to	you. 
The participant who encountered this mechanism 
responded favorably. She was surprised that the icon 
would  enable  her  to  exercise  her  preferences,  and 
appreciated  learning  about  it.  This  tool  required 

Page3785 

ticking a checkbox next to companies from which she 
wanted  to  opt  out  (there  was  only  one  in  the  list—
DoubleClick), then tapping a button that said, “Opt-
out  from  selected  companies.”  After  she  ticked  the 
checkbox, she zoomed out to read the information in 
the right column under the heading, “About interest-
based-advertising.”  Once  she  read  the  button  and 
tapped it, the checkbox turned into tiny text that said, 
“opted  out,”  which  she  did  not  notice  at  first.  She 
tapped  the  button  again,  read  its  text  aloud,  then 
noticed the change. 

 Such different experiences of exercising “choice” 
can impact a user’s mental model of what will protect 
their  privacy.  They  may  think  using  one  of  these 
choice mechanisms precludes them from receiving all 
behaviorally  targeted  advertising,  which  is  not  the 
case. Opt-out cookies are needed from all advertising 
companies  that  would  place  ads  on  a  user’s  device, 
and only work for that device. Even then, this would 
only prevent behaviorally-targeted ad placement and 
not necessarily inhibit the tracking of the consumer. 
It is worth noting that none of the icons used in this 
study led to the Consumer Choices Page for Mobile 
Web, where users can opt out from many companies 
at  once.  The  icons  we  tested  all  led  to  an  opt-out 
mechanism of one particular ad network, presumably 
the one placing the ad on which the icon appeared. 
 
5.  Discussion  

 
Our  study  showed  several  design  problems  that 
impact  the  usability,  and  therefore  effectiveness,  of 
AdChoices disclosures in the mobile environment.  
5.1.  AdChoices disclosure design 

 
The  Schaub  et  al.  taxonomy  considers  four 
dimensions  of  the  privacy  notice  design  space: 
timing, channel, modality, and control. The timing of 
the  AdChoices  disclosure  could  be  considered  “just 
in  time,”  in  that  it  is  shown  on  a  behaviorally-
targeted ad when it is placed. Since it is provided on 
the  same  device  with  which  the  user  interacts,  it  is 
delivered through a primary channel. The modality of 
the icon is visual, and is sometimes includes a textual 
notice  beside  it.  In  terms  of  control,  the  icon  is 
supposed to link to an opt-out choice mechanism. It 
is a non-blocking notice in that it does not require the 
user  to  interact  with  it.  Because  of  this,  it  is  often 
ignored.  It  is  usually  decoupled  from  the  choice 
mechanism  with  a  varying  amount  of  information 
between them.  

Despite  previous  research  that  found  both  this 
icon and the phrase “AdChoices” to be ineffective in 

 

 

communicating about OBA practices and options [9], 
[40],  the  industry  is  committed  to  using  both  as  the 
cornerstone  of  its  self-regulatory  notice-and-choice 
program. While the disclosures are being used more 
consistently  than  in  previous  years,  there  is  still  a 
lack of continuity in how they appear and function. 
5.2.  Finding the AdChoices icon 

 

 
Many  participants  had 

the 
AdChoices  icon  on  a  mobile  news  website,  despite 
being  shown  the  icon  beforehand.  There  are  several 
factors that may have contributed to this difficulty. 

locating 

trouble 

The arbitrary symbol and its tiny size impede its 
discoverability, in that if users do not know what it is 
or  cannot  see  it,  they  will  not  know  it  serves  as  a 
gateway to choices regarding OBA.  

tapping 

The  color  contrast  ratio  of  the  icon  is  quite  low, 
which  may  be  exacerbated  by  the  background  on 
which it appears and varying levels of transparency. 
This  can  also  compromise  the  icon’s  visibility. 
Another factor that made the icon difficult to find in 
some instances was a state change of the icon or the 
ad: several participants passed an X while searching 
for the icon. The icon’s position on an ad also varied 
in different cases; it might be found in any of the ad’s 
four  corners.  Furthermore,  at  times  it  was  placed  in 
the top right corner and alternated with an X, which 
emulates  the  web  convention  of  a  window  closing 
mechanism. In that case, the X is false signifier of a 
close mechanism that did not exist: tapping it led to 
the  same  outcome  as 
icon.  One 
participant even mentioned this seemed deceptive. 
5.3.  Using the AdChoices icon 

 
Norman [46] says a good conceptual model gives 
users  an  accurate  idea  of  how  the  system  actually 
works,  which  improves  their  ability  to  use  it.  The 
icon  falls  short  in  this  regard.  Most  users  did  not 
understand that the icon was a link separate from the 
ad,  let  alone  that  it  would  lead  to  an  opt-out 
mechanism.  Tapping  the  icon  led  to  a  variety  of 
outcomes  in  this  study,  none  of  which  included 
linking  to  the  Consumer  Choices  webpage.  Also,  it 
led not only to different types of feedback events on 
first tap (i.e., AdChoices phrase appears or interstitial 
with more links appears), but a second tap linked to 
various opt-out tools for a particular company placing 
the  ad.  This  lack  of  consistency  can  inhibit  users’ 
understanding  of  how  OBA  disclosures  work.  A 
better solution would be for the icon to consistently 
take  the  user  to  the  Consumer  Choices  page,  where 
they can opt out of many companies at once.

5.4.  Study limitations 

refreshes 

accidental  page 

 
Our  study  had  several  limitations.  The  fact  that 
we used actual phones (rather than simulations, as in 
other  studies)  was  generally  a  strength  that  yielded 
rich, realistic qualitative data. However, it did present 
challenges. Participants did not use their own phones, 
with which they may have been able to interact more 
easily.  There  were  also  technical  difficulties:  Wi-Fi 
network  interruptions,  unexpected  alert  messages, 
and 
the 
consistency  of  participants’  experiences  during  the 
study. Using active webpages created challenges for 
consistency. We could not control for ads with icons. 
Finally, most of the icons we found led to the About 
Google  Ads  webpage.  Considering  the  DAA  has 
more  than  300  member  companies,  there  are  likely 
many more scenarios we could have experienced had 
we  encountered  ads  placed  by  different  networks. 
The  two  others  we  did  encounter,  RocketFuel  and 
Evidon, offered very different experiences. 
 
6.  Conclusions

This  study  sought  to  explore  the  usability  of  the 
DAA’s  consumer  choice 
the  mobile 
environment. Consistent with previous studies, major 
usability  problems  were  found  that  can  negatively 
impact  a  user’s  understanding  of  the  notice-and-
choice  model  that  is  at  the  heart  of  the  online 
advertising 
efforts, 
specifically with the use of the AdChoices icon.  

self-regulatory 

industry’s 

Considering the icon was designed by an industry 
whose expertise lies in creating noticeable messages, 
it falls short of its efforts to establish notice, let alone 
make  choice  evident.  And  while  the  DAA  website 
claims  its  icon  appears  more  than  a  trillion  times 
monthly,  our  study  corroborates  Leon  et  al.  [46]  in 
finding  that  participants  still  have  a  hard  time 
noticing  it  and  generally  do  not  understand  what  it 
means  if  and  when  they  do.  More  importantly,  we 
found that mobile device affordances and constraints 
both 
identified  usability 
problems and create a propensity for new ones.

Abstract 

Research on the history of print culture and library service to immigrants in America has almost 
exclusively focused on European  immigration to the East Coast. Such a narrative sidelines the 
experience of Asian Americans, among others. This article explores how the Library of Hawaii, 
which was the main public library in prewar Hawaiʻi, ignored the needs of Japanese immigrants 
at a time when they made up the largest ethnic group. In 1940, there were 157,905 Japanese 
Americans  in  Hawaiʻi,  including  the  first  generation  Issei,  many  of  whom  had  limited  English 
proficiency,  as  well  as  the  Hawaiʻi-born  Nisei  or  second  generation.  Excluded  from  the  public 
library,  the  Issei  created  their  own  rich  print  culture,  including  at  least  41  stores  selling 
Japanese-language books. This paper is based on archival sources and published reports to cover 
the  Library’s  history.  In  addition,  the  forgotten  history  of  Japanese  bookstores  and  reading  in 
Honolulu  will  be  brought  to  light  by  mining  articles  and  advertisements  that  appeared  in 
Honolulu’s Japanese American newspapers between the late 1800s and the beginning of World 
War II, when Japanese bookselling came to an abrupt end. The paper makes advances in terms 
of  research  approaches  for  the  study  of  immigrant  print  culture  and  also  offers  insight  for 
librarians today to reflect on, when they consider the challenge of serving immigrants.

Introduction 

A 

merican librarians are increasingly embracing the vision of Jaeger et al. (2015) that libraries
are social service institutions and human rights advocates. In many communities, a key part
of this vision is serving immigrants with world language collections, literacy programs, and 
other  services.  Although  reasons  for  extensive  library  services  for  and  outreach  to  immigrant 
communities in the early 20th century could be interpreted differently, it cannot be denied that 
many libraries acted as missionaries to promote collections, services, and programs targeted at 
new  immigrants,  focusing  on  introducing  English  and  American  governance.  Some  libraries 
excelled in such efforts, while others did not make  immigrant outreach or services a priority. 
Many of the success stories came from the East Coast and Midwest, where librarians embraced 
European immigrants. Much less is known about library services to Asian immigrants on the West 
Coast or Pacific. This article attempts to begin filling this gap by looking at the experience of 
Japanese immigrants to Hawaiʻi around a century ago.1 It focuses on how the Territory’s public 
library was not responsive to the immigrant community’s desire to read in their native language, 
something we now recognize as a fundamental human right.2 This tacit exclusion led Japanese 
Americans to develop their own commercial reading sphere that could satisfy their hunger for

books and magazines.  

Hawaiʻi  in  1940  was  home  to  one  of  the  largest  Japanese  ethnic  communities  outside  of  the 
Japanese  Empire.  That  year’s  census  showed  that  the Japanese  American  community  grew  to 
157,905  people,  accounting  for  over  37%  of  people  living  in  the  Territory  of  Hawaiʻi.  This 
Japanese  American  community  created  a  vibrant  cultural  landscape  and  print  culture  in  both 
English  and  Japanese,  which  included  at  least  41  stores  selling  Japanese  language  books  and 
magazines in Honolulu alone between 1896 and 1942. Today, only one bookshop remains.  

In this paper, we explore how the Japanese immigrant print culture emerged, and how it served 
as an antithesis to the relative indifference  displayed by the Territory’s public library towards 
Japanese language readers. In order to do so, we will begin by briefly summarizing (1) the history 
of  Japanese  immigration  to  Hawaiʻi,  (2)  library  service  to  immigrants  in  early  20th-century 
America, and (3) the history of the Territory’s public library, the Library of Hawaii. Along the 
way  we  will  also  introduce  our  research  methods  based  on  ethnographic  textual  reading  of 
primary historical records. Only a few local Japanese histories offer at least a sketchy description 
of  a  few  bookstores  or  readers  scattered  in  such  sections  as  local  businesses,  culture,  or 
social/pastime activities; however, beyond those few anecdotal stories, this article is the first 
dedicated  to  Japanese  bookstores  and  reading  in  Hawaiʻi.  In  our  research,  we  chiefly  rely  on 
Japanese-language  newspapers  in  Honolulu  and  primary  materials  housed  in  the  Hawaiʻi  State 
Archives  and  the  University  of  Hawaiʻi  special  collections,  triangulating  this  information  using 
immigrant  community  histories,  yearbooks,  histories,  unpublished  diaries,  and  census  records 
and other data found at Ancestry.com. This is the first known article uniquely focused on the 
Japanese print culture and bookstores in Hawaiʻi.  

A Brief Account of Japanese Immigration to Hawaiʻi  

Immigration is always a story of forces pushing and pulling within a wider global socio-economic 
context; how the story is told depends on the chosen vantage point. For Native Hawaiians,  or 
Kanaka  Maoli,  1778  is  a  key  date—over  a  century  before  the  arrival  of  Japanese  immigrants—
when Captain James Cook “discovered” the Hawaiian Islands. This European contact led to visits 
by  whalers  and  traders  who  brought  diseases  that  decimated  much  of  the  Kanaka  population. 
The foreigners pillaged the land for  sandalwood and other natural resources. Missionaries also 
came and settled, transforming Kanaka culture and beliefs. The missionaries’ children had the 
most  impact.  Many  became  advisers  to  Hawaiʻi’s  monarchs  and  used  their  position  to  enrich 
themselves with land, which was later exploited for large sugar and pineapple plantations. These 
European American settlers initially recruited Chinese laborers to work on plantations, and then 
later  recruited  Japanese  workers;  these  Asian  settlers  had  to  follow  the  brutal  “Masters  and 
Servants Act” (Na Haku A Me Na Kauwa) (Beechert, 1985).  Under that system, plantation workers 
were not called by name, but by their bango, or tag number, a practice borrowed from Southern 
slave  plantations  (University  of  Hawaiʻi,  2018).  This  indentured  system  ended  with  American 
annexation, but it obviously determined how European Americans (or haole, in local parlance) 
and Kanaka viewed Asian Americans (Beechert, 1985).  

For Japanese workers, the appeal  of employment in Hawaiʻi came at a time when many were 
displaced by the disruption of Meiji era industrialization, from peasant farmers and craftsmen to 
former samurai [traditional warriors], thus representing both ends of the class structure.3 The 
first group was allowed to leave Japan in 1868. Larger cohorts emigrated to Hawaiʻi starting in 
1885, which was in the final years of the Hawaiian Kingdom’s reign (1795-1893) and continued 
into Hawaiʻi’s Republic period (1894-1898) and finally into the first half of the U.S. Territorial

era  (1900-1924).  The  Territorial  era  lasted  until  1959,  but  the  1924  Immigration  Act  halted 
Japanese immigration to Hawaiʻi.4 After completing their initial labor contracts, some Japanese 
stayed on plantations, while others found other work in cities like Honolulu, left for the American 
continent,  or  returned  to  Japan.  Many  of  those  Issei  (first  generation)  male  immigrants  later 
brought  wives  to  Hawaiʻi  and  established  coffee  farms  or  other  small  businesses.  Thus,  these 
“sojourners” became “settlers.”5 Despite the decision of many Issei to live in Hawaiʻi, Japanese 
immigrants  were  largely  forbidden  from  becoming  U.S.  citizens  until  racist  legislation  was 
replaced  in  1952.  However,  the  Issei’s  children  (the  Nisei,  the  second  generation)  and 
grandchildren (the Sansei) were American citizens by birth.   

Haole sugar and pineapple planters tried to recruit laborers from various countries in order to 
prevent workers from organizing or striking to improve their harsh conditions; however, Japanese 
American workers did just this in 1909 and 1920. The 1920 labor action was more successful, as 
they cooperated with Filipino American workers instead of letting planters pit different ethnic 
groups against each other. The process of organizing led Issei workers towards developing class 
consciousness and reaching the improved pay and working conditions (Okihiro, 1991).6 Regardless 
of whether Japanese American families stayed at or left the plantations, their children went to 
public schools in Hawaiʻi. By 1928, Nisei children made up 52% of all public-school students in 
the Territory (Tamura, 1994, p. 30). Despite their citizen status, Japanese Americans in Hawaiʻi 
faced  continued  discrimination  and  palpable  glass  ceilings.  In  the  next  sections,  after  a  brief 
review of the history of American library service for immigrants, we will explore how Hawaiʻi’s 
public library served (or underserved) Japanese Americans in the prewar times.  

Public Library Service to Immigrants in North America 

Many people may see libraries as an organic foundation of every American community, but it is 
important to remember that, like all institutions, they are shaped in response to changing socio-
political and economic conditions. Immigration is a core part of the library creation narrative, 
starting  in  New  England.  Established  in  1852,  the  Boston  Public  Library  was  the  model  tax-
supported  public  library,  established  by  elite  philanthropists  who  professed  belief  in  sharing 
reading  materials  for  the  general  public  in  order  to  promote  democracy  and  prosperity.  The 
Brahmin  (Boston’s  Protestant  elites)  who  founded  the  library  also  had  other  agendas.  One  of 
them was their anxiety that Irish Catholic immigrants, who arrived in large numbers following 
the  Great  Irish  Famine  (1845–1852),  would  soon  become  Boston’s  largest  ethnic  and  religious 
group.  These  immigrants  benefited  greatly  from  Boston’s  creation  of  public  schools,  public 
hospitals, and the public library. In a controversial article, library historian Michael Harris applied 
Gramscian  analysis7  to  suggest  that  the  library  was created  as  an  agent  of  social  control  over 
these immigrants. Harris argued: 

Boston’s  Brahmins  were  especially  unhappy  about  the  flood  of  ignorant  and  rough 
immigrants  into  this  country.  The  standing  committee  of  the  Boston  Public  Library 
noted that the people of Boston spent large sums of money on education each year, 
and their reasons were quite explicit: “We educate to restrain from vice, as much as 
to inculcate sentiments of virtue; we educate to enable men to resist the temptation 
to evil, as well as to encourage and strengthen the incentives to do good.” But, the 
committee continued, these times require special vigilance. (Harris, 1975, p. 6) 

Harris explores how the Boston Public Library codified different classes of readers with different 
reading rooms and collections. Harris’ article caused perhaps the most epic debate in the field 
of library history. Columbia University Library Historian, Phyllis Dain (1978) questioned Harris’

method  and  argued  that  he  overgeneralized  about  the  nature  of  libraries  by  focusing  on  the 
Boston Public Library. Dain (1972) shared her own research on the New York Public Library, which 
was formed out of a merger of several private and ethnic libraries. Their debate was not only 
printed  in  specialized  historical  journals  but  appeared  in  the  profession’s  leading  trade 
periodical, The Library Journal. 

Despite their differences, both Harris and Dain agreed that services for immigrants were central 
to the library narrative, which was also evident from other works. Echoing Harris, Jones’ 1999 
classic  Libraries,  Immigrants,  and  the  American  Experience,  which  traced  the  history  of  the 
American  Library  Association  (ALA)  Committee  on  Work  with  the  Foreign  Born  (operational 
between 1917 and 1948), also observed that librarians of the time period frequently identified 
with  social  workers  and  other  social  reformers  as  missionaries  of  Americanization.  Developing 
foreign language collections and promotional materials that explained library services in many 
languages was a key part of the Americanization campaign. Gradually, librarians’ attitudes and 
philosophy  with  regard  to  immigrants  had  changed,  as  Jones  observes,  progressing  from 
“angloconformity, [to] melting pot, or cultural pluralism” (1999, p. 2). Based on the facts and 
arguments advanced by Harris, Dain, and Jones, it would be logical to assume that the Boston 
Brahmin, who were the missionaries and traders in early Hawaiʻi, would have wanted their library 
to follow the Boston model, irrespective of their agenda and reasons for engaging immigrants. 
However, it was not necessarily the case, as will be shown below.  

The Origins of the Library of Hawaii 

The  Honolulu  Library  and  Reading  Room  Association  (HLRRA)  was  officially  established  with  a 
royal charter on June 24, 1879.  A write-up in the local annual claimed the HLRRA “is organized 
on the most broad and liberal basis, the membership being open to all respectable persons of 
sixteen years old or upwards at an entrance fee of $1.50  per month without any distinction of 
race, creed nationality or sex or nationality” (Thrum, 1880, pp. 26–28). Despite the egalitarian 
language, this private library mostly served Honolulu’s European American population, although 
it  did  welcome  both  genders.  A  review  of  the  hundreds  of  memberships  listed  in  its  Register 
shows that almost all names suggest European descent. The number of Japanese subscribers was 
small (Honolulu Library and Reading Room Association, n.d.). Tachihata (1981) makes a general 
observation that “only a few Hawaiians and the exceptional Asian were able to read English,” 
and “even fewer were interested in the use of libraries” (p. 32).8 It is true that the five Japanese 
names which appeared in the library’s membership were elite among the immigrant community, 
including  a  doctor,  priests,  and  a  banker,  but  it  is  equally  interesting  to  see  that  their 
subscriptions did not last for more than a few months. This shows that at least one librarian saw 
fit to approve their applications; however, this may also suggest that they did not feel welcomed 
and  included,  which  led  them  to  discontinue  their  membership.  The  library  subscribed  to  a 
number of world language items but never purchased anything in Japanese. This is a pattern that 
we will see in the publicly funded Library of Hawaii throughout the next half-century, as we will 
see in the following section (Honolulu Library and Reading Room Association, n.d.).9 

The HLRRA subscription library’s financial state was poor. At the same time, K-12 school teachers 
in Honolulu clamored for more books for their students. The situation motivated two of Hawaiʻi’s 
Washington-appointed  governors  to  try  securing  funding  from  Andrew  Carnegie  for  a  library 
building (Ramachandran, 1973). After several years of negotiations, it was agreed to have the 
Territory provide space and the usual 10% of the building budget for library funding in order to 
meet  the  eligibility  criteria  for  a  Carnegie  grant  to  build  what  would  become  the  Library  of

Hawaii.  The  HLRRA  subscription  library  agreed  to  contribute  its  collection  in  exchange  for  a 
position on the public library’s board of trustees. The governor would always allocate another 
board  position  to  an  officer  of  the  Hawaiian  Historical  Society,  which  also  shared  the  library 
space. The board’s minutes show the remaining appointments went to Christian clergy and other 
haole elites. Edna Allyn, the HLRRA’s librarian became the librarian at the new public library, 
where she served as a head librarian until her death in 1927.    

Library Service to Japanese Americans 

It  is  not  surprising  that  many  subscription  libraries  were  akin  to  elite  clubs,  but  there  is  an 
expectation  that  a  public  library,  funded  by  taxpayers’  money,  should  provide  services  to  all 
community  members.  In  reality,  though,  the  Library  of  Hawaii  ignored  the  reading  needs  of 
Japanese immigrants for at least the first three decades of its operation as a public library and 
improved  only  slightly  at  the  following  stage.  By  1910,  during  the  period  between  the  public 
library’s establishment and the completion of the Carnegie Library, there were 191,909 people 
in the Territory, with Japanese Americans comprising 41.5% of the population (79,675 people); 
this clearly made them the largest ethnic group in the Territory (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1913, 
p.  9).  This  fact  notwithstanding,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  Library10  attempted  to  serve 
Japanese Americans for the first few decades.  

Librarians wrote in general terms about Americanizing Japanese children in some annual reports, 
reflecting both the wider Americanization movement discussed above and the local conditions in 
Hawaiʻi, where elites now feared that racists in the Congress and media would hinder Hawaiʻi’s 
chances at statehood on account of their dissatisfaction with the large Asian population on the 
islands.11 In a 1920s letter, one librarian lamented that “lack of funds precluded the purchase of 
Hawaiian and Japanese books requested by patrons in hospitals” (Tachihata, 1981, pp. 135, 164). 
The  Library  never  seemed  to  find  funds  for  Japanese  books  in  their  general  or  reference 
collections either. At the same time, Library annual reports and monthly board statements show 
the  purchase  of  books  in  Russian,  Greek,  French,  and  Latin.  It  is  true  that  the  Library  was 
underfunded  vis-à-vis  ALA  recommendations  for  per  capita  spending;  however,  this  may  also 
indicate that the Library deprioiritized requests for Japanese language collections in its budget, 
despite  the  readers’  demand.  It  is  not  clear  if  the  decision  not  to  acquire  Japanese-language 
materials  was  made  by  Ms.  Allyn  as  the  librarian  or  by  the  Library  trustees,  but  this  policy 
continued throughout the pre-war era.12  

The  policy  of  deprioritizing  materials  in  Japanese  or  other  Asian  languages  despite  popular 
demand  ran  contrary  to  the  trend  observed  in  most  American  urban  libraries,  which  tried  to 
secure books in languages other than English in order to bring in immigrants and their children: 
Swedish  immigrants  in  Minnesota;  Jewish  and  Chinese  in  New  York;  and  Polish  immigrants  in 
Cleveland (Novotny, 2003, pp. 342–352; Jones, 1999). Even considering the relative geographic 
distance from continental urban centers to Hawaiʻi, it is unlikely that librarians on the islands 
were  not  aware  of  the  trends  in  other  libraries.  Each  year  the  Library  Trustees  sent  a  staff 
member to attend the ALA Annual Conference. These librarians often took a month  or two to 
make  the  journey,  doing  research  visits  at  many  public  libraries  along  the  way  (Hawaiʻi 
Department  of  Education,  n.d.)    Furthermore,  Ms.  Allyn  herself  was  a  graduate  of  the  Case 
Western  University  Library  School  and  later  worked  at  the  Cleveland  Public  Library,  which 
became  a  national  leader  in  serving  immigrants.  Beyond  that,  the  Library  received  annual 
updates from ALA’s Committee for Work with the Foreign Born in the monthly ALA Bulletin.

17Library Exclusion and the Rise of Japanese Bookstores in Prewar Honolulu 

In 1936, nearly a quarter-century after the Library’s opening, and nine years after Ms. Allyn’s 
death,  the  Library  finally  allowed  Japanese  books  in  the  collection,  although  it  still  did  not 
engage  in  the  systematic  acquisition  of  Japanese  books.  The  change  came  about  when  the 
Japanese community decided to create a Japanese reference collection on its own. The Library 
of Hawaii trustees allowed what it called the “Oriental Collection” in an alcove on the second 
floor. It took over a year and a trip to Japan for Japanese community leaders to collect 3,000 
books in both Japanese and English (Bazzell, 2002, p. 61).  In this way, the Japanese-language 
collection  matched  the  Library’s  Daughters  of  the  American  Revolution  Genealogy  Collection, 
the  Hawaiian  Historical  Society  collection,  and  what  would  later  be  called  the  of  Hawaiʻi  and 
Pacific Collection. While the Library deserves some credit for allocating space for the Oriental 
Collection,  the  collection  itself  could  not  be  attributed  to  Library  efforts  or  initiatives.  In 
essence,  the  Library  continued  disregarding  the  reading  and  information  needs  of  Japanese 
immigrants.  Moreover,  the  Library  threatened—twice—to  close  the  Oriental  Collection  if  the 
Japanese community stopped funding the salary of a custodian who maintained it.  

Very  little  funds  were  expended  on  Japanese-language  books,  although  some  titles  were 
purchased from the Japanese book distributor Maruzen in 1916 (Library of Hawaii, 1919); aside 
from this, there is no evidence of active Japanese-language acquisitions. Unlike books in other 
languages, Japanese-language books did not appear in any annual tables with summaries of the 
Library’s collection, while they showed continuous acquisitions in other languages. For example, 
the collection in 1922 contained 54,435 items, including the following in world languages: French 
(411),  German  (219),  Hawaiian  (4),  Italian  (3),  Latin  (2),  and  Spanish  (41)  (Library  of  Hawaii, 
1922). Interestingly, other than Hawaiian and Spanish, these languages were spoken by only  a 
handful  of  immigrants  in  the  Territory  at  the  time;  however,  they  were  likely  taught  at  elite 
schools and higher education institutions. This could be an indicator of the preferred social strata 
that the Library catered for. Also, we could speculate that these choices may have reflected the 
reading tastes of Ms. Allyn, the head librarian, who had a Bachelor of Arts in Latin; these decisions 
could  also  be  consistent  with  collection  development  biases  by  early  librarians  and  Library 
trustees.13  

From this brief overview, it becomes clear that the Library of Hawaii failed to serve the thousands 
of Japanese-language readers. Because so few primary materials are available, we cannot know 
for certain why the  Library decided to exclude this group. Perhaps, the librarian and trustees 
believed that Asians were simply transient or not fully capable of Americanization —beliefs that 
echoed the eugenic, racist thinking of the era (Manganaro, 2012). Or perhaps they believed that 
the Library should be a beacon of English-language Protestant conformity in a place many haole 
saw as an overseas colony. We can only make assumptions at this point. One thing is clear: most 
Japanese  immigrants  were  neither  illiterate  nor  uninterested  in  reading.  Despite  a  certain 
percentage  of  low-literate  individuals,  there  was  a  significant  community  of  highly  literate 
readers,  hungry  for  Japanese  printed  materials.  This  is  evident  by  the  establishment  and 
development of Japanese bookstores in Honolulu, on which we will concentrate in our subsequent 
sections, after first describing historical methods and sources that we used to unveil a rich world 
of Japanese bookstores in Hawaiʻi. 

Methodology 

Print culture historians use a variety of sources and tools in order to try to reconstruct the rather 
quiet act of reading and often undocumented book sale transactions (Zboray & Zboray, 2000).  
The previous section was based on a variety of sources, found primarily in archives and published

reports.  However,  researching  Japanese  bookstores,  which  were  private  and  have  since 
disappeared, required different sources and approaches, including the very close and creative 
reading  of  sources  based  on  our  understanding  of  historical  context.  By  so  doing,  we  tried  to 
decipher a forgotten history. Unfortunately, with the exception of works on Japanese American 
newspapers and Issei and Nisei writers, there is a dearth of information on Japanese American 
print culture (Hayashi, 1990; Mizuno, 2000; Srikanth & Song, 2016; Tamura 1986).  

Immigrant communities in early 20th-century America were often temporal ones located in low-
rent  areas,  and  such  institutions  as  ethnic  bookshops  are  usually  more  interested  in  serving 
immediate community needs and staying solvent rather than documenting their own experience. 
In  the  U.S.,  immigration  has  often  been  seen  as  a  “migrant”  or  “temporary”  existence,  a 
transitional state often associated with poverty and other struggles of resettlement that people 
try to escape and leave behind (e.g., Howe, 1976, p. 614). In this context, it is very difficult to 
document  immigrant  bookstores.  Immigrant  reading  is  an  even  harder  aspect to  record  unless 
one does targeted surveys (e.g., Dali, 2004). 

Another  complication,  specific  to  locating  information  on  Japanese  American  history,  is  the 
disruptive impact of World War II. Hawaiʻi differed from the American West Coast in that there 
was no forced detention of all ethnic Japanese; however, there was perhaps even more stigma 
in Hawaiʻi about maintaining anything in Japanese during the long period of Martial Law.14  Even 
before the war, local police and the Honolulu Federal Bureau of Investigation office created A, 
B, and C lists of Issei and Nisei who were seen as possibly disloyal—lists which included Japanese 
American newspaper editors, printers, language school teachers, Christian, Buddhist, and Shinto 
clergy,  and  at  least  one  bookseller.  In  such  an  environment,  many  ethnic  Japanese  discarded 
anything written in Japanese (Scheiber & Scheiber, 2016).  

To  help  uncover  the  world  of  Japanese  bookstores,  we  have  searched  Honolulu’s  Japanese-
language  newspapers  using  the  Hoover  Institution  database,  a  recently  launched  project  to 
digitize Japanese American newspapers (Wertheimer & Asato, 2018).  Specifically, we draw on 
bookstore  advertisements  appearing  in  three  vernacular  newspapers  published  in  Honolulu, 
which collectively covered the period under discussion: starting as  the Yamato, a semi-weekly 
newspaper  published  by  Shintaro  Anno  (1895–1896),  which  later  became  the  Yamato  Shinbun 
(1896–1906) and then changed its title to the Nippu Jiji (1906–1942). The Nippu Jiji under the 
editorship of Yasutaro Soga had a wide readership among Japanese immigrants in Honolulu and 
played  a  key  role  in  shaping  community  opinions  on  many  social  issues  (Tamura,  1986).    The 
newspaper collection includes OCR-scanned (optical character recognition) text, so it is possible 
to search over years, including advertisements. The searches were made for such terms as shoten 
[bookstores], honya [bookstores], shosekiten [bookstores], hon [books], tosho [books], shoseki 
[books],  zasshi  [magazines],  dokusho  [reading],  dokusha  [readers],  dokushokai  [reading  club], 
and kodoku [subscription]. Additional searches were made for the names of  specific Japanese 
publications, the names of Japanese bookstores, and merchants in Hawaiʻi. We then created our 
own spreadsheet listing each bookshop, proprietor, address, dates of advertisements, and some 
notes on promoted titles in order to capture the wide range of bookselling during the period of 
study.  

Searching the newspaper produced two types of evidence. One was articles and editorials by the 
newspaper staff on reading and bookstores. The other type, which proved far more valuable, was 
advertisements about books and bookstores. These can be reasonably assumed to be reflections 
of what the local community read, as well as indicators of trends and the reading environment 
in the ethnic community. Although some articles and advertisements focused on certain genres,

taken as a whole they give insight into the diversity of the Japanese-language reading society. 
We can read these critically as texts to trace how bookstores selected their stocks from the great 
output of Japanese publishers and how they curated lists designed to appeal to their current and 
potential  customers.    Through  these  advertisements we were able to see an  imprint left  of the 
changing nature and values of the ethnic Japanese readers in Hawaiʻi.  

For biographies of bookstore owners, Hawai nihonjin nenkan [Hawaiʻi Japanese yearbook], Hawai 
nihonjin meikan [Japanese who’s who] and Hawai jitsugyo annai [Guide to businesses in Hawaiʻi] 
were particularly useful resources. Soga’s memoir, Gojuunenkan no Hawai kaiko [My memoirs of 
fifty years in Hawaiʻi] offers additional insights into a wide variety of topics as he had a long career 
as editor and publisher of the Nippu Jiji. Some of these rare publications are available only in print 
through the University of Hawaiʻi, Hawaiian and Pacific and Japan Studies collections. The primary 
materials on the early Library of Hawaii are also only in print housed in the Hawaiʻi State Archives. 
This  information was  triangulated  through  immigrant community  histories, yearbooks,  histories, 
unpublished diaries, and census records and other data found at Ancestry.com. Our research builds 
on the work of Hibi (2008), Wada (2016), and Wertheimer (2004) that look at Japanese American 
print cultures, although this is the first known article uniquely focused on the situation in Hawaiʻi.  

Early Japanese Bookstores 

On January 27th, 1942, a brief article appeared in the Nippu Jiji, one of Honolulu’s daily Japanese 
newspapers, announcing a liquidation sale at Morishige Shosekiten or bookstore.  According to the 
article, Matazo Morishige, an immigrant from Hiroshima, had established his bookshop in 1900, the 
same year Hawaiʻi became an American Territory. It was located on Beretania Street, one of the 
city’s busiest thoroughfares, and home to many Japanese American stores. The article claimed that 
the  supposedly  oldest Japanese  bookstore was  closing  its  doors  after  40  years. The  closure was 
perhaps inevitable because importing Japanese books became impossible once the war began.  

The article was only partially correct, as the history of Japanese bookselling in Hawaiʻi goes back 
even  further—with  roots  in  the  final  era  of  the  Hawaiian  Kingdom  (1795–1893).  We  have  found 
records  of  immigrants  peddling  Japanese  books  in  so  called  “Japanese  quarters”  or  “Japanese 
camps” in sugar plantations to fellow Japanese immigrants (“Kojiki bozu,” 1909) dating back to at 
least 1892. Several records mention Sanshichi Ozaki, who hailed from Kanagawa Prefecture, as the 
first one to portage books. With his load of books over both shoulders, he sold Japanese immigrant 
workers ezoshi [picture books] for 20–30 cents and novels for 70–80 cents. This is how the Ozaki 
Shōten, or general store, began its history. The Ozaki Store and the Iwakami, Takemura, and Mie 
stores were  pioneering  shops  in  Honolulu.  The  owners  brought  funds with  them  from  Japan  and 
began their businesses as general merchants, also selling books. However, the majority of Japanese 
stores were established by people who came to Hawaiʻi originally as immigrant laborers (Morita, 
1919, p. 124). 

Japanese bookstores, especially in the early settlement years of Japanese immigration, were one 
of a few access points for immigrants to consistently receive information from their home country; 
another  one  was  local  Japanese-language  newspapers.  During  this  time  period,  few  Issei  were 
fluent enough in English to rely on English-language newspapers. Bookstores also functioned as hubs 
for the local Japanese culture, information centers for the ethnic group, and a cross-cultural point 
between their home  and host countries. By examining  those  bookstores,  this  paper  attempts to 
answer questions, such as who were the Issei and Nisei as readers of Japanese publications; what 
they read; and how their reading influenced or helped shape their identity in Hawaiʻi.

Japanese Bookstores in Honolulu before 1900 

Several Honolulu stores sold Japanese books during the Republic of Hawaii era (1894–1898). They 
placed advertisements promoting Japanese books in Honolulu’s vernacular newspapers. Table 1 
shows some of these stores and selected advertised items before 1900.

These  shōten  (or  stores)  functioned  as  general  merchants,  but  many  Honolulu  shops  also  sold 
wholesale to retailers on other islands in the Territory. They dealt in almost anything immigrants 
needed for everyday living: from Japanese foods and clothing and various tools and tableware to 
drugs and fresh vegetables. Along with these daily goods, Japanese novels and dictionaries were 
sold  as  miscellaneous  items.  Most  of  the  stores  in  question  were  located  on  Beretania  Street 
where many Japanese quarters existed (Haga, 1981; Iida, 2013, p. 171).   

Around  that  time,  sales  were  usually  done  by  credit.  The  closed  ethnic  community,  whose 
members were dependent and reliant on each other, made such a trust-based business practice 
possible. In that era, actual cash payments qualified one for a “discount” price in Murakami and 
Horita  stores.  Customers  living  on  other  islands  requesting  books  from  the  Tanaka  Store  were 
required to enclose a money order. Presumably, store owners trusted the customers they knew 
who lived in their neighborhood. This credit system created problems as the number of residents 
increased and the community kept growing, and a few customers escaped their debts by fleeing 
to  Japan  or  the  Continental  U.S.  (Hayashi,  1909).    In  1908,  the  Honolulu  Japanese  Retailers 
Association resolved that all credit sales should be paid in full by the end of each month (Honolulu 
kourisho kumiai, 1908). Although these varied stores were not dedicated bookstores, they were 
visited by enough dedicated Japanese readers who were excited about newly arrived publications 
from  Japan.  These  advertisements  appeared  in  the  local  vernacular  newspapers,  the  Yamato 
(1895–1896)  and  the  Yamato  Shinbun  (1896–1906),  between  July  1896  and  May  1898.    The

readership was obviously steady for the Takemura Store to announce the arrival of a new issue 
of the literary monthly magazine, Bungei Kurabu [Literature Club] (Ishimaru, n.d.). 

In  his  memoir,  Yasutaro  Soga,  the  owner-editor  of  Honolulu’s  daily,  the  Nippu  Jiji,  reminisced 
about  his  earlier  experience  working  at  a  Japanese  store  in  a  plantation  town  on  the  Island  of 
Hawaiʻi.  He recalled,  “these  stores were  like  tiny  department  stores” (Soga,  1953,  p. 19). They 
carried  literally  anything  one  needed  for  Japanese  everyday  life,  including  food,  kimono, 
chinaware, medicine,  alcohol, and  papers.  Reflecting  his  upbringing  and taste, he  wrote “since 
their customers were plantation workers, there were no ‘real books,’ but such vulgar-taste readings 
as kodanbon [storybooks or oral narratives] were plentiful in the store” (p. 19).  The store sent two 
clerks to the camp two to three times a day to collect orders from hard-working immigrants who 
had no time to visit the shop. On Saturdays and Sundays, however, he remembered, many workers 
would come in person. In addition to purchasing items, some customers also asked for help writing 
letters or consulted on various matters. Stores, continued Soga, supposedly should not have been 
open  on  Sundays  but  customers  came  in  the  back  door.  Store  owners  in  the  early  plantation 
communities  in rural Oahu had  a  similar role:  “keeping mail  and  writing letters for  people,  and 
working as agents of the Japanese Consulate. . . . The Japanese store on the plantation was an 
oasis in the community (Odo, & Sinoto, 1985, p. 11).  From these descriptions of early stores, we 
can  easily  picture  Japanese  immigrants  converging  there  to  shop,  socialize,  and  spend  their 
precious free time. Through this connecting with the world beyond the daily travail of plantation 
life, stores emerged as a third place to talk with neighbors, receive news, and read newly arrived 
Japanese books, newspapers, and magazines.15  

Japanese Bookstores in the 1900s and 1910s 

The  Japanese  population  of  Honolulu  grew  as  Issei  completed  their  plantation  contracts, 
especially  after  the  1909  strike  when  strikers  were  evicted  from  their  plantation  homes. 
Japanese immigrants found work in other businesses, thus creating an urbanized and a somewhat 
more middle-class culture and settler marketplace, which eventually included dedicated stores 
selling books.  

As noted in the previous section, books were sold with  other merchandise in general stores in 
Honolulu.  Another  type  of  establishment  that  sold  a  somewhat  greater  variety  of  books  and 
magazines was pharmacies. Tanseido, for example, was founded in 1918 by Ichitaro Tomita and 
his fellow countryman pharmacist Tsutomu Ota with $10,000 in start-up capital. The following is 
a reflection on the store’s success:  

Pharmacies  in America  sold much  more  than  medicine and  medical equipment,  such  as 
cosmetics, stationery, musical instruments, daily necessities, tobacco, cameras, and even 
soft drinks. They looked like department stores. Generally American stores close around 
5:00 or 6:00, but pharmacies remained open throughout the night; so naturally they attract 
various kinds of customers. . . . The store is located at the intersection of two busy streets, 
Beretania  and  River,  a  perfect  location  for  a  retailer,  but  it  is  also  successful  as  a 
wholesaler,  as  it  frequently  sends  employees  to  the  neighbor  islands.  (Nippu  Jiji  Co. 
Henshukyoku, 1921, 50) 

This description of Tanseido explains well why so many Japanese pharmacies existed in Honolulu 
and why they sold books and magazines. In addition to the local Japanese-language newspapers, 
and before newsreels and radio broadcasts from Japan came to Hawaiʻi, publications imported 
from Japan had been one of a few sources for the Japanese immigrants to learn about the current

state  of  Japanese  politics,  cultural  trends,  technology,  and  about  the  news  from  Japan  and 
around the world. In this era, so far removed from the Internet days, the desire for “up-to-date 
information” must have had a special status as a commodity, and naturally attracted regulars 
with the new stock. This also explains why so many stores in the ethnic community carried newly 
arrived  books  and  magazines  regardless  of  whether  they  were  primarily  dry  goods  shops  or  a 
pharmacy.  The  description  of  Tanseido  rather  resembles  that  of  a  24/7  convenience  store  in 
Japan today, where customers drop in for a coffee or snack and end up spending an hour browsing 
magazines. Indeed, two years after opening, Tanseido added a soda fountain, while continuing 
to sell books, as well as art supplies, toys, and Japanese games shogi and go (Tanseido, 1920). 

As the economy developed and readers became more demanding, some stores  started placing 
more emphasis on an even greater variety of Japanese publications. These new specialized book 
stores opened on Beretania Street, forming a bookstore neighborhood similar to Kanda-Jimbocho 
in today’s Tokyo. Those stores even imported less profitable specialized and literary magazines 
to appeal to different types of Japanese readers (“Shimachi no seinen,” 1911). As one example, 
Matsumura Bookstore, was started by Masaho Matsumura who had arrived in Hawaiʻi in 1906 from 
Hiroshima when he was 24-years-old (Sogawa, 1927, p. 258). An advertisement from February 
26,  1908  announced  his  store’s  opening,  proudly  boasting  its  “BOOKS”  and  stationery 
specialization in large bold type. Matsumura explained that he could provide fast book delivery 
because  he  established  special  contracts  with  Japan’s  leading  bookstores.  His  stock  included 
books, magazines, national textbooks, reference books, wall maps, some of Japan’s leading local 
newspapers, and stationery goods. The textbooks and  maps must have been most welcome at 
local Japanese language schools which taught children who came to Hawaiʻi with their immigrant 
parents as well as the locally born Nisei (Asato, 2006).  

The number of Japanese language schools mushroomed, and by 1915, there were at least 120 in 
Hawaiʻi (Ozawa, 1972). That year 13,552 Japanese American pupils attended around 160 public 
schools in Hawaiʻi, 90% of whom also attended ethnic afternoon schools learning language, ethics, 
calligraphy and other subjects (Asato, 2006, p. 11; Hawaii Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
1920, p. 74). 

In 1908, the newly opened Matsumura bookstore made  a dramatic debut by inviting  Nippu Jiji 
readers to a dodoitsu competition; dodoitsu are limericks composed in a 7-7-7-5 syllable pattern. 
Winners would receive gift certificates for books: $1.50 for the first prize, $1, and 50 cents for 
the second and third prizes (“Dai nikai kensho,” 1908). The following are translations of some of 
the winning selections which were printed in the newspaper:  

The elegant store display, forever prosper—Matsumura bookstore. (“Obo dodoitsu,” 
1908d). 

Passing rain, showering on the pine tree, inviting me to stop by the bookstore. (“Obo 
dodoitsu,” 1908d).  

Ardent love woven into a bookmark, returning a book placed as a suggestive message.

What  for  collecting  unnecessary  books,  enjoy  reading  in  the  autumn  night .  (“Obo 
dodoitsu,” 1908a). 

Holding my favorite book, tears come out, again forgot this kanji, how to read. (“Obo

Collecting  Japanese  and  Western  cookbooks,  practicing  for  a  new  family.  (“Obo 
dodoitsu,” 1908c). 

Halt reading  and  half close  a  book,  what  I learned  first  is  the  taste  of  love. (“Obo 
dodoitsu,” 1908c). 

These brief poems allowed the Issei to express their inner passion for reading and how Japanese 
language books were integral to their practical and emotional existence.  If it were not for the 
bookstore, those amateur writers might have never had a chance to share their art or see their 
names in print as authors. As a form of art, dodoitsu is seen more low-brow compared with the 
refined form of haiku. It was originally performed with shamisen, a traditional Japanese three-
stringed  lute,  sometimes  at  an entertainment  theater but  more  commonly  at  drinking  places. 
The  themes  are  often  feelings,  love,  cynicism,  dry  humor,  or  self-mockery  (Kurata,  n.d.). 
Obviously the dodoitsu competition attracted many readers and created an immediate literary 
circle through the local newspaper. Around that time, the price of a typical Japanese book ranged 
from 30 cents to $1.50 (Motoshige Shōten Shosekibu, April 5, 1915). The winners were probably 
proud  to  take  home  a  winning  book  or  two  of  their  favorite  writers.  Beyond  simply  winning  a 
prize, these expressions help us imagine the profound emotional response that Japanese books 
inspired  in  the  hidden  cultural  lives  of  Hawaiʻi’s  ethnic  Japanese  community.  They  also 
counteract a stereotypical and erroneous association of Japanese immigration with low levels of 
literacy and the lack of literary aspirations.  

What Books and Magazines Did the Japanese Americans Read? 

In the 1910s, if Japanese Americans in Honolulu were to walk into a local Japanese store, what 
kind of books would they find on the shelves? We tried to answer this question by perusing the 
list of advertised books. Motoshige Shinjudo was started as a pharmacy on N. King Street in 1897 
by Wasuke Motoshige who had left Tokyo for Hawaiʻi three years earlier (Tanaka shōten, 1897; 
Hawai  nihonjin  nenkan,  1916,  13,  p.  152).  He  became  very  successful  and  later  opened  two 
branch stores—one in the Oahu plantation town of Waipahu and the other in Wailua on the island 
of Kauaʻi. These stores developed into a trading company, and Motoshige became one of the most 
prominent  businessmen  in  the  early  Japanese  American  community  in  Hawaiʻi.  Unlike  many 
general stores, the Motoshige store’s opening advertisement did not mention books; however, by 
1912–1915, its book department regularly published full page newspaper advertisements, listing 
over 400 titles at a time (see Figure 1). Judging by the lists, there might be at least 1,000–1,500 
books on the shelves on any given day. The advertisement dated August 5, 1912 classified books 
into nine categories (Motoshige Shōten Shosekibu, August 5, 1912).   

Those  categories  include  Shuyo  [moral,  self-improvement];  Cookbooks,  Household;  Hygiene, 
Divination,  Hypnotism;  Waka,  Haiku  [Japanese  poetry],  Western  and  Japanese  musical 
instruments  and  instruction;  Japanese-English  Conversation,  Dictionaries,  Translated  English 
Books; Japanese Literature; Dictionaries; Math, Accounting, Law; and Miscellaneous. Each book 
listed the title, author, and price.

25Library Exclusion and the Rise of Japanese Bookstores in Prewar Honolulu 

The book advertisement of Motoshige Store eloquently speaks to us about the socio-cultural and 
spiritual state of the Japanese American community. The most salient category to reflect their 
spiritual needs was “Shuyo” books on self-improvement or morals. Many Issei immigrants packed 
one or two shuyo books in their kori [bamboo basket trunks] as an aspiration to maintain their 
Japanese  spirit  and  culture  even  when  living  abroad.16  This  category  includes  books  on  the 
samurai  code,  old  adages,  words  and  inspirational  biographies  of  famous  people  including 
Japanese and Western figures. Parallels might be drawn to early American home book collections 
featuring Poor Richard’s Almanack, Psalms, or Bibles, which were read intensively for inspiration 
and  guidance,  as  well  as  poetic  works  intended  for  reading  aloud  (Brown  2007,  p.  164).    The 
category  of  “Literature”  around  this  time  consisted  mostly  of  classical  literature  rather  than 
popular novels, including anthologies of Japanese and Chinese writers. Waka and haiku are short 
poems: both have specific literary rules and formulae to follow and are considered more refined 
poetry forms than popular ones, such as dodoitsu. Waka and haiku are taught at school as part 
of educating cultural and well-rounded citizens. Therefore, this category also manifests Japanese 
Americans’ spiritual and cultural ties with Japan. 

There also are categories of advertised books that may point to readers’ willingness to learn and 
adopt American culture and lifestyle. In the early bookstore advertisements, the most common 
items  were  Japanese-English  dictionaries,  books  for  learning  business  English  and  everyday 
conversation, and titles such as  A Quick Mastery of English in Six Months. This is not a unique 
characteristic  of  Japanese  bookstores  alone,  but  one  that  is  shared  with  ethnic  bookstores 
established  by  other  American  immigrant  communities;  many  ethnic  bookstores  often  had  a 
section  of  books  for  English  learners.  For  Japanese,  the  language  mastery  was  uniquely 
challenging  because  of  the  significant  differences  between  English  and  Japanese  languages. 
Indeed, linguists in the Modern Language Association and the Foreign Service Institute classify 
Japanese as being the most distant from English, and thus the most challenging to learn (Foreign 
Service Institute, n.d.). The language and communication gap created a serious hurdle for many 
Issei  in  terms  of  improving  their  quality  of  work  and  life  and  building  relationships  outside  of 
their community. To overcome this hurdle, young Issei men went to night schools or worked as 
“schoolboys” to learn English (Murakami, 2016, p. 190).  This naturally produced many anecdotal 
stories and incidents with dictionaries and other English learning books (“Tochi yagakko,” 1908). 

The category of “Cookbooks, Household” is a mixture of East and West (Motoshige Shōten, August 
5, 1912). This category of books reflects the exposure of Japanese women to  Western culture 
and the beginning of women’s liberty, independence, and social, cultural establishment in Japan. 
Seito, a literary magazine for women (1911) influenced by Western feminism, created a sensation 
in Japanese society because of its focus on women’s freedom and challenge to old social customs 
(Ide,  n.d.).  Although  Japanese  American  women  in  Honolulu  geographically  lived  in  American 
society, their everyday lives were often confined to the ethnic community, where life followed 
Japanese  language  and  custom.  However,  the  1924  Immigration  Act  spurred  a  gradual  change 
from  Japanese  “sojourner  spirit”  to  one  of  “settlement”  as  the  Americanization  Movement 
intensified in the islands. (Hawai Nihonjin Iminshi, 1964, p. 336). This was in tandem with efforts 
to Westernize Issei clothing, from kimono to western clothing, which allowed for a more active 
lifestyle, as well as an emphasis on using English, and increasing contact outside the community 
(Hawai Nihonjin Iminshi, 1964, p. 336). 

Therefore, it is possible that imported publications from Japan, which reflected on the drastic 
Westernization of Japanese society became a medium of Western culture, helping Issei women 
in Honolulu learn new customs and facilitating their transition to the host society. In this way, 
such bookstores as Motoshige became a cultural conduit for adaptation and adjustment.

The final category of advertisements was “Miscellaneous books” and contained true gems. 
It listed the two books published by the Motoshige Stor e. Both were written by Acchi Takei, 
a  well-known  benshi  or  storyteller,  who  traveled  around  Japanese  American  communities 
and  plantations  and  wrote  about  their  lives.  One  was  Hawai  no  Miyage  [Souvenirs  of 
Hawaiʻi], a photo sketchbook of the Hawaiian Islands. This $1.50 book was rather pricey but 
still popular as a gift for relatives in Japan; as a result, it was printed in three editions after 
selling 8,000 copies. As a publisher, the Motoshige Store wholesaled this bestselling book to 
other retailers, such as Seiseido Pharmacy (see Figure 2), Shigi Pharmacy, Oshima Pharmacy, 
Machida  Pharmacy,  Shigemori  Pharmacy  and  the  Nakatsu  Store  (Motoshige  shōten,  August 
5,  1912).  All  are  medium  to  large-scale  stores,  which  frequently  promoted  their  own 
publications in newspaper advertisements.

Other  local  stores,  newspapers,  companies,  and  even  individuals  also  published  quite  a  few 
books, especially with the focus on Hawaiʻi. However, with a few exceptions, none of them was 
a dedicated publisher, and instead they only printed a book or two (Hawai Nihonjin Iminshi Kanko 
Iinkai, 1964, pp. 302–307). Those bookstores/publishers preserved the ethnic community history 
which might have otherwise disappeared and dissolved into American history. As a result of their 
efforts,  by  the  end  of  the  1910s,  a  distinct  print  culture,  including  publishers,  distributors, 
bookstores,  and  readers  emerged  within  the  Honolulu  Japanese  American  community.  It  was 
transnational yet independent and unique, which paradoxically flourished because socio-cultural 
exclusion promoted self-reliance and self-sufficiency.

The Rise of Magazines from the 1920s to 1941  

The  Japanese  American  population  marked  a  significant  increase  in  the  1920s  and  continued 
rising  even  after  World  War  II.  In  1920,  the  number  of  the  Issei  was  60,258  while  there  were 
49,016 Nisei with American citizenship. However, by 1929, the size of the two groups reversed: 
the  Nisei  now  outnumbered  the  non-citizen  Issei:  87,748  and  49,659,  respectively  (Hawai 
Nihonjin Iminshi Kanko Iinkai, 1964, p. 316). This shift coincided with a magazine boom in Japan. 
In Hawaiʻi this demographic change greatly expanded the impact of the magazine boom among 
Japanese publications imported to Hawaiʻi. This was a serious issue for bookstores as most Nisei 
were far more comfortable with English than Japanese. Even as they became adults, many read 
in Japanese at the level closer to that of children in Japan, and their reading in Japanese may 
have  been  limited  to  magazines  that  offered  furigana  [phonetic  characters]  used  alongside 
difficult kanji [Chinese characters]. The main exception was a subset of the Nisei called the Kibei 
Nisei who had spent some time attending school in Japan. Yamashiro (1995) estimates there were 
4,000 Kibei-Nisei in Hawaiʻi by 1940.  

In  Japan,  book  and  magazine  sales  had  been  booming,  especially  following  news  of  Japan’s 
victory  in  the  (first)  Sino-Japanese  War  (1894–1895).  The  war  boosted  Japan’s  economy  and 
energized the publishing world, especially fueling the hunger of readers wanting to see photos 
and patriotic accounts from the battlefield. In this era, Tokyo’s Hakubunkan became the largest 
publisher,  rising  to  stardom  by  releasing  three  popular  magazines  Taiyo  [The  Sun;  a  general 
magazine], Bungei Kurabu [Literary Club; a literary magazine], and Shonen Sekai [Boy’s World; 
a  boys’  magazine],  which  drove  the  magazine  boom  in  Japan  (Hashimoto,  1964,  p.  59). 
Hakubunkan  released  a  series  of  inexpensive  magazines  and  tankobon,  paperbacks  geared 
towards  the  interest  of  specific  groups  of  readers.  Their  record  sales  shattered  the  previous 
belief that magazine publishing was not profitable (“Shimachi no seinen,” 1911). These popular 
magazines  created  new categories  of  reading,  including  women’s,  girls’  and  boys’  reading,  as 
well as popular satire, adventure, war hero novels, and military novels. Needless to say, these 
new genres produced new groups of readers both domestically and in the diaspora. Specialized 
readerships also allowed for targeted advertisements, which kept the prices more affordable and 
fostered modern Japan’s consumer culture.  

Japanese-language Magazines for Women 

Back  in  Hawaiʻi,  Oshima  Pharmacy  on  Beretania  Street  operated  by  Kisaburo  Oshima  from 
Yamaguchi,  published  an  advertisement  appealing  to  women  readers  with  a  list  of  popular 
magazines; Fujin Sekai [Women’s World]; Fujo Kai [Ladies’ World]; Fujin Kurabu [Women’s Club]; 
Fujin Koron [Women’s Review]; and Fujin Gaho [Women’s Pictorial Magazine] (Hayashi, 1909, p. 
207; Oshima Yakuho Shosekibu, 1926). It also promoted the leading monthly magazine the Shufu 
no Tomo [The Housewife’s Friend] (1917–2008), which launched a women’s magazine boom and 
had a record readership of 220,000 by the late 1920s in Japan. The editor refocused the original 
target audience of women’s magazines from the minority of upper class, well-educated women 
to the popular market of housewives, signaling the change by offering “everyday wisdom” and 
information on how to “improve” their lives. For example, in addition to many short stories and 
serialized novels, the December issue of 1930 contained such articles as “A wife’s effort to create 
a happy married life”; “How to quickly change your husband’s bad mood”; “Secrets of finding a 
good husband for your daughter”; and “Secrets of putting on makeup” (see Figure 3). The 80-
cent issue offered an extra-gift booklet on “the secret of how to  perform divination for luck” 
and also a prize contest for 1,000 rings with a lucky stone (Shufu no Tomosha, 1930). Because of 
these magazines’ popularity, many bookstores advertised the impending arrival of forthcoming

issues, warning potential readers that the “last month’s issue quickly sold  out, so secure your 
copy right now!” Every month more than 20,000 copies of various magazines were imported and 
sold in Hawaiʻi. Amazingly, those magazines were displayed in Honolulu stores at almost the same 
time as in bookstores in Japan (“Risoteki na shogyo,” 1939).

Women as Readers  

A November 1922 advertisement for the aforementioned Morishige Bookstore—one of Hawaiʻi’s 
oldest  Japanese  bookstores  (1900–1942)—also  focused  on  serving  women  readers  (Morishige 
Shosekiten,  November  19,  1922).  The  piece  titled  “Women  and  Reading”  explained  that 
“recently women’s desire for reading is rising,” and encouraged readers to look at the 50 books

selected for women in the store by Tokyo’s Jiji Shinpo Dissemination of Reading Society. Their 
list  included  books  on  home  psychology,  theory  of  life,  and  Western  music;  biographies  of 
successful women; an anthology of poetry by modern women poets; lectures on women’s culture; 
and a young ladies’ life of thought. Books by prominent women writers, such as feminist poet 
Akiko Yosano, and some  English books in Japanese translation were also on the recommended 
list. This selection of 50 readings for women reflects a cultural elitism, signifying Japan’s modern 
education system introduced in the 1870s, which places a great emphasis on literacy and reading 
as a pathway to modern nationhood. Around the late 1910s and 1920s, Japan was caught in the 
Kyoyoshugi [self-cultivationism] fever, whereby reading was valued much higher than writing or 
speaking. It was seen as a vital communication skill to understand the national essence. Reading 
was considered a core educational tool to instill state-sanctioned social and political values in 
citizens. For this, works of philosophy were central. The followers argued that acquiring a good 
understanding of philosophy through reading is essential to maintaining the national ethos. This 
“philosophy boom” began in 1922 and brought philosophy into school curricula in Japan (Kamei-
Dyche, 2017).  

The  aforementioned  titles  suggest  that  the  targeted  readers  of  these  books  were  rather 
intelligent and receptive to Western ideas, perhaps reflecting the mood of the somewhat more 
democratic  Taisho  era  (1912–1926)  which  had  just  ended  (Okubo,  n.d.).  The  intended  female 
readership was more likely to be situated in the upper middle-class and consisted of women who 
could  afford  $1.50–$6.00  books,  which  were  significantly  more  expensive  than  most  popular 
books of the time (Morishige Shosekiten, November 19, 1922). This image of women dramatically 
contrasts with the image of female readers who read the popular women’s magazines described 
earlier. Whether or not there was a significant overlap between these two female readerships 
requires further investigation.  

An interesting question that comes to mind is how the Issei and Nisei women in Hawaiʻi read the 
women’s magazines and books and what aspects of those publications appealed to them. On the 
one hand, the publications in question codified old Japanese customs, in which women’s roles 
were  defined  by  traditional  values,  tasks,  skills,  and  expectation.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
magazines put forth some Western concepts, including new values, lifestyles, and, most clearly, 
high  expectations  for  modernization.  One  explanation  could  be  that  these  Japanese-language 
materials helped Issei women adapt to American society, even more so than they helped men. 
Many Issei women could not read English-language publications and had limited exposure outside 
the  ethnic  community;  under  these  circumstances,  learning  Western  lifestyles,  social  norms, 
culture, and values through Japanese-language publications was the only viable option. If this is 
indeed  the  case,  in  a  paradoxical  way,  Japanese  printed  materials,  a  physical  token  of  their 
attachment to Japan’s old culture and customs, may have actually aided their acculturation in 
the new country. Whatever the case may be, the publishing industry in Japan did an excellent 
job of cultivating women as a new group of readers and of establishing unique genres for women 
readers.  By  1939,  the  industry  had  grown  so  strong  that  women’s  paperbacks  alone  sold  six 
million copies; this constituted a 20% increase from the  previous year. Reflecting the national 
thinking  of  Japan,  already  at  war,  the  most  significant  sales  increases  were  in  women’s 
publications and works related to patriotism and the war (“Yoshi tosei,” 1939).   

Social Role of Japanese Bookstores 

Beyond selling books and magazines, Japanese bookstores in Hawaiʻi continued to offer additional 
services. For example, the aforementioned Morishige Bookstore’s November 1922 advertisement

also solicited new year magazine subscriptions. It offered a 20% discount on the advance payment 
for subscriptions and promised that magazines would be delivered quickly by store clerks directly 
to Honolulu addresses. The  bookstore also offered a readers’ advisory service: “Because there 
are so many magazines to select from . . . we will be happy to listen to your needs and select 
one for your convenience.” The advertisement also noted: “Various kogiroku or lecture notes are 
also available” (Morishige Shosekiten, November 12, 1922). This genre was frequently found in 
Honolulu bookstores’ advertisements starting the 1910s. Japanese Americans purchased them to 
study  various  academic  subjects  on  their  own  using  prestigious  Japanese  universities’  course 
lecture notes. The advertisement proudly boasted about a young man who studied using their 
kogiroku  to  become  a  newspaper  reporter.  However,  as  in  Japan,  most  readers  studied  with 
kogiroku  not  for  the  purpose  of  formal  education  but  for  their  own  self-improvement.  The 
kogiroku  was  developed  in  the  spirit  of  public  education  by  some  instructors,  somewhat 
resembling  today’s  MOOCs  and  other  public  scholarship  (Sekimoto,  2014).  Upon  a  customer’s 
request,  the  bookstore  also  provided  bibliographies  of  books,  similar  to  those  that  American 
libraries compiled for their patrons.  

These  bookstores  not  only  provided  their  readers  with  books  and  magazines  but,  like  public 
libraries today, also offered spaces for such entertainment opportunities as sponsored movies, 
acrobatic theater, and dodoitsu competitions.  They hosted celebrations of both American and 
Japanese holidays in the ethnic community. However, this all came to an end shortly after the 
last shipment from Japan was unloaded from the Asama in August 1941. The boycott and Pacific 
War forced all of these stores close (“Toketsurei ga motarashita,” 1941). Although the US joined 
World War II in 1941, Japan had already been embroiled in war in China for several years, and 
the government placed increasingly tight controls on what were acceptable themes for all types 
of  publications  (Garon,  1998).  Following  the  end  of  the  war  and  martial  rule,  only  a  few 
bookstores would try to resume.17  

Discussion and Conclusion 

This  paper  portrayed  the  rich  reading  lives  of  Japanese  immigrants  in  Hawaiʻi  by  focusing  on 
Japanese-language bookstores in the diaspora. Their funds were scarce and earned by hard work 
in the fields, but their spiritual life was bolstered by Japanese-language books and magazines. 
These early Japanese readers in America consumed books for many reasons:  escape, relationship 
building, maintaining national identity, hunger for information, search for joy and leisure, coping 
with homesickness, alienation, and nostalgia, economic advancement, artistic expression, and 
lifelong  learning  in  a  fast-changing  modern  age.  This  article  demonstrates  that  Japanese 
language books and magazines played countless roles in serving as a life connection between the 
home and the host country.  

Unfortunately,  as  we  have  also  shown,  the  Library  of  Hawaii  did  not  take  much  interest  in 
responding to information and reading needs of Japanese-language readers of the time. Outside 
of  Hawaiʻi,  American  libraries were  slowly  developing  their  services  towards  more  democratic 
and equal services, a concept that would eventually be codified in the 1939 Library Bill of Rights:  

Books and other reading matter selected for purchase books and other reading matter 
selected  for  purchase  from  public  funds  should  be chosen  for value  and  interest  to 
people of the community, and in no case should the selection be influenced by the 
race or nationality or the political or religious views of the writers. (ALA Office for 
Intellectual Freedom, 1974, p. 4)

Although the reasons for active services and outreach to immigrant communities in other states 
may or may not have been motivated by the considerations of social justice and equity, these 
services nonetheless existed on a fairly extensive scale. This contrasts with the lack of services 
and collections to and, likely, interest in Japanese-speaking patrons in Hawaiʻi.  

As our research clarifies, in Hawaiʻi’s Territorial Library, books were not selected with community 
needs in mind, unless the Library limited the definition of community to the minority population 
of haole native  English  speakers. By the same token, race, nationality, religion, and language 
were  obvious  determining  factors  in  designating  books  as  worthy  of  purchase.  Although  there 
were no legal restrictions on the use of libraries by Japanese immigrants or their offspring, the 
Library collection certain sent a message that the Issei presence was not welcomed. In this way 
the Library of Hawaii remained a colonial missionary outpost with what was, in essence, a policy 
that valued mostly European languages. 

The  deficiency  of  services  and  resources  on  the  part  of  the  Library  of  Hawaii  prompted  the 
community  to  find  solutions  of  their  own  and  bolstered  the  development  of  ethic  publishing, 
bookselling,  and  cultural  institutions.  We  can  see  this  as  acts  of  resistance,  consumption,  or 
adoption, depending  immigrants chose to read. It was  also an act of cultural survival, akin to 
building and maintaining temples, shrines, and churches that met spiritual needs, or language 
schools  where  the  Issei  tried  to  pass  on  their  language  and  culture  to  their  children  and 
grandchildren. Whatever the case may be, creating their own bookstores was a way of meeting 
basic communal and individual needs. 

This paper only begins to scratch the surface of this rich immigrant print culture. There is a need 
for  more  research  on  topics  like  Kibei  reading,  Japanese  library  collections,  locally  published 
works of fiction and nonfiction, and literary circles; there is also a need for comparative studies 
between Japanese American print culture and the print culture experiences of other Asian Pacific 
Americans,  especially  Native  Hawaiians,  as  well  as  with  other  Japanese  diasporas.  Another 
worthwhile  research  project  could  focus  on  comparing  the  Library  of  Hawaii  with  libraries  in 
Puerto Rico or American Samoa, the other sites of libraries in American territories where English 
was  not  the  dominant  language.  The  early  20th-century  American  influence  also  extended  to 
Cuba  and  the  Philippines,  which  might  also  provide  an  interesting  research  angle.  Such  an 
approach  could  make  possible  a  comparison  of  libraries  under  American  imperialism  with 
Coleman’s (2008) study of British colonial libraries within the very different frame of American 
imperialism  (Kinzer,  2006;  Hopkins,  2018.)  Another  line  of  future  research  could  extend  to 
American  public  libraries  in  the  states,  territories,  and  Native  American  reservations  with 
multilingual minorities or majorities. For those interested in libraries of today, our study provides 
much  ground  for  reflection  on  the  role  of  library  services  for  immigrants,  especially  in 
communities  with  restrictions  on  using  tax  support  for  undocumented  immigrants.  It  is  our 
sincere  hope  that  the  portrayal  of  the  Japanese  cultural  resilience  and  prosperity  in  the 
conditions of disregard by the local public library will encourage librarians to strive to truly meet 
the ideals set by the Library Bill of Rights.

Endnotes

1 There are three spellings of Hawaiʻi in this article. We usually use it with the diacritics, as it is 
written and pronounced in Hawaiian and in official usage today. Before statehood, the Territory 
did not adopt diacritics, so we maintained the old spelling for the Library of Hawaii and Territory 
of  Hawaii.  When  citing  something  in  Japanese  we  used  the  Japanese  transliteration,  which  is 
written as Hawai with only one “i” without diacritics. By “Territory,” we refer to: the Territory 
of  Hawaii,  which  was  established  by  the  Hawaiian  Organic  Act  of  1900,  following  the  1898 
annexation by the U.S. In 1959, the Territorial era ended when Congress passed the Admission 
Act, making it the 50th state. 

2 The right to read in any language is protected under Articles 2, 18, 20, 26, 27, and especially 
19  of  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  (1948)  as  well  as  other  UN  and  UNESCO 
covenants. In the U.S., it is guaranteed by the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.  

3 Japan’s Meiji era (1868-1912) saw the return of power to the Emperor, an intense industrial 
revolution  in  order  to  support  national  defense  and  international  trade.  It  also  marked  the 
beginning of Japanese emigration (Keene, 2005). 

4  Japanese  immigration  to  other  parts  of  the  U.S.  were  largely  halted  by  the  so-called 
“Gentlemen's Agreement” of 1907-1908. See Daniels (1988).  

5  Some scholars now call Asian Americans in Hawaiʻi “Asian Settler colonialists” although ‘settler’ 
predates this discourse. See Fujikane and Okamura (2008). The term settler here parallels the 
transformation  European  immigrants  would  signify  by  applying  for  American  citizenship—
something forbidden to Japanese immigrants.  

6 Issei plantation workers organized a Federation of Labor, having realized that they had more in 
common  with  Filipino  plantation  workers  than  with  Issei  elites.  Takaki  (1983)  notes,  “To  be 
successful,  the  labor  movement  in  Hawaii  and  its  strike  actions  would  have  to  be  based  on 
interethnic working class unity” (p. 164).  

7  For  those  unfamiliar,  Antonio  Gramsci  (1891-1937)  was  an  Italian  social  theorist  and  Marxist 
politician. He is most well known for his extensive Prison Notebooks, which explored many ideas, 
including the concept of “Cultural hegemony.” Gramsci pointed out how schools and other state 
organs function to normatize capitalist power structures. For more, see Mayo (2008). 

8 Some recent studies (e.g., Laimana, 2011), may dispute this finding; we are also conducting 
additional research on Issei English and Japanese literacy.  

9 Readers interested in the Library’s history would benefit from Tachihata’s dissertation (1981) 
or  the  brief  work  by  historian  Loomis  (1979),  published  by  the  Friends  of  the  Library.  Loomis 
wrote on early missionary history as a historian and great-granddaughter of the first printer in 
Hawaiʻi, missionary Elisha Loomis.  

10 All capitalized instances of “Library” refer to the Library of Hawaii.

11  Hawaiʻi’s  Territorial  Legislature  passed  countless  bills  calling  for  Statehood,  but  U.S. 
Congressmen from the West Coast and South united to opposed to statehood, primarily because 
they were opposed to the idea  of enfranchising the  Territory’s Asian Americans. See Reinecke 
(1979), Daws (1968, pp. 333, 389), Hirobe (2001). 

12 Few of the Library’s internal records survive, but the Minutes of the Library of Hawaii Trustees 
(in an unprocessed collection at the State Archives) were reviewed; they offered little insight.  

13  For  insight  into  the  biases  of  librarians  and  library  education,  see  Wayne  Wiegand’s  (1996) 
critical biography of Melvil Dewey, who played an active role in founding the ALA, The Library 
Journal, and the first library school.  

14 During World War II, racism against Japanese Americans and wartime hysteria following the 
Pearl Harbor attack led the federal government to incarcerate all 120,000 Japanese Americans 
from their homes on the West Coast regardless of citizenship. Officials and community leaders 
in Hawaiʻi were able to placate calls for mass incarceration. They claimed they arrested the most 
disloyal.  In  the  end,  almost  2,000  of  Hawaiʻi’s  roughly  158,000  Japanese  Americans  were 
detained. Another reason Hawaiʻi Japanese Americans did not suffer the same “internment” was 
that the Territory was under Martial law for most of the war (Scheiber & Scheiber, 2016). 

15 The concept of third place comes from sociology, where a third space is an alternative to home 
(first place) and work (second place).  In an interesting twist, Pozzi (2013) makes the case for 
how libraries and bookstores helped create an Italian immigrant space in Newark, New Jersey.   

16 See O, H. (2010) for an overview of Shuyo books that inspired many Meiji era immigrants.  

17 The Territory of Hawaii was placed under military rule, with the civilian government pushed 
aside for the first three years of the war. Many civil rights, such as the writ of habeas corpus, 
were  swept  aside.  It  was  the  longest  period  of  martial  rule  in  the  U.S.  (Scheiber  &  Scheiber, 
2016).

Abstract 

This  paper  outlines  an  implementation  of  an  analytic 
framework  that  addresses  the  need  to  understand 
socio-technical  networks  as  intertwined  processes  at 
local  and  network  levels  of  agency  distributed  across 
various  media.  We  integrate  data  sources  in  a  single 
abstract  transcript  of  events,  and  identify  empirical 
relationships between these events to build a graph of 
uptake  relations—how  one  act  builds  on  another.  We 
then  use  cohesive  subgraph  detection  to  identify 
“sessions”  in  the  space-time  dimensions  represented 
by these graphs. Analysis can then focus on individual 
sessions  and  identify  key  actors  within  these  sessions 
using  sociometrics,  or  find  relationships  between 
sessions  that  might  be  vectors  for  the  transmission  of 
ideas or practices. An example is provided using data 
from the Tapped In educator professional network.  

1.  Introduction 
Socio-technical  networks  such  as  online  communities 
and social media can involve intertwined processes at 
individual, small group, and network levels of agency 
distributed  across  various  media.  Phenomena  of 
interest may involve multiple processes that have been 
theorized  and  investigated  separately  [11,  14].  For 
example, theories of learning in social settings vary in 
the agent of learning (e.g., individual, small group, or 
community),  and  in  the  process  or  ‘mechanism’  of 
learning  (e.g.,  information  transfer,  intersubjective 
meaning-making,  shifts  in  participation  and  identity, 
and  accretion  of  cultural  capital)  [17].  Learning  and 
other phenomena of interest take place simultaneously 
at  all  of  these  levels  of  agency  and  with  all  of  these 
processes. Thus, understanding socio-technical systems 
requires revealing the relationships between individual 
and  collective 
levels  of  agency  and  potentially 
coordinating analysis at multiple time scales [9].  

The  multifaceted  and  multi-granular  nature  of 
participation  and  production  of 
individual  and 
collective  value  in  socio-technical  networks  presents 
an analytic challenge that motivates the work reported 
here: how to meaningfully connect analytic approaches

micro-analysis  of  interaction  (e.g.,  of  chat  sessions) 
shows 
and 
accomplishments in the moment, but the relationships 
latent  in  these  interactions  must  be  identified  and 
aggregated 
identify  clusters  of  activity  and 
communities  of  actors.  Yet,  aggregated  graphs  of  ties 
fail  to  capture  the  means  by  which  these  ties  were 
accomplished,  so  such  graphs  are  insufficient  for 
understanding the network without also examining the 
interactions 
derived. 
Communities  of  actors  empirically  emerge  from  the 
moment-to-moment  interactions  between  actors,  but 
also influence the potential for such interactions. These 
observations  motivate  our  use  of  layered  data  and 
analytic  representations  that  bridge  between  session 
and network granularities of analysis.  

from  which 

they  were 

We  developed  our  methods  using  historical  data 
from  Tapped  In®,  an  environment 
that  offered 
asynchronous threaded discussions, quasi-synchronous 
chat,  file  sharing,  and  other  media  for  interaction  [6, 
16].  Participants  included  a  mixture  of  members  of 
organizations  and  others  who  came  to  the  socio-
technical network of their own accord. All participants 
were  free  to  wander  between  specific  settings  and 
events.  Consequently,  the  data  generated  by  a  given 
participant  resulted  in  different  kinds  of  traces  in  the 
log files associated with these media, at different times 
and different virtual spaces. The trace of a participant’s 
unitary experience is fragmented across these logs, and 
needs  to  be  reassembled  to  reveal  this  activity.  For 
example,  Tapped  In  chat  events  were  recorded  in 
distinct  files  for  each  chat  room,  while  other  events 
such  as  posting  discussion  messages  or  sharing  files 
were  recorded  in  a  database  as  web  interface  events. 
Thus, if a participant chatted in a reception room and 
participated  in  chat-based  events  held  in  two  group-
meeting rooms, and also read some threaded discussion 
messages  in  one  of  the  rooms,  that  participant’s 
activity would be recorded in four different persistent 
stores. This presents a second analytic challenge: how 
to  reassemble  fragmented  traces  of  activity  into  a 
single analytic artifact.  

to  prior  events  by 

To  preview  our  approach,  logs  of  events  are 
abstracted and merged into a single abstract transcript 
of  events,  and  this  is  used  to  derive  a  series  of 
representations  that  support  levels  of  analysis  of 
interaction  and  of  ties.  Three  kinds  of  graphs  model 
interaction:  Contingency  graphs  record  how  events 
such  as  chatting  or  posting  a  message  are  observably 
related 
temporal  and  spatial 
proximity  and  by  content.    Uptake  graphs  aggregate 
the multiple contingencies between each pair of events 
to model how each given act may be “taking up” prior 
acts.  Session graphs are abstractions of uptake graphs: 
they  cluster  events  into  spatio-temporal  sessions  and 
capture  relationships  between  sessions.  Relationships 
between  actors  and  artifacts  are  abstracted  from 
interaction  graphs  to  obtain  “associograms”  [20,  21], 
which can be folded into traditional sociograms.

Other  publications  have  detailed  some  of  the 
theory  [8,  17]  and  analytic  representations  [19,  21] 
this  paper  we  report  on 
behind 
computational  methods  we  have  developed 
for 
transforming  log  files  into  interaction  and  session 
graphs  and  sociograms,  and  methods  for  drawing 
conclusions  based  on  these  representations.  First,  we 
provide  an  overview  of  the  series  of  computational 
transformations  taken.  Then,  details  of  the  methods 
will be provided in the context of an extended example 
using the Tapped In data. 
2.  Overview of the Framework 
The  representations  used  at  various  levels  of  analysis 
are shown in Figure 1 (next page). At the bottom, we 
exemplify  various  traces  of  activity  (such  as  log  files 
of events) that provide the source data. (HTTP logs are 
shown  just  for  illustration:  our  actual  data  includes 
database  logs  and  textual  transcripts  of  chats.)  These 
are parsed using methods that are necessarily system-
specific  to  abstract  log  entries  into  an  event  stream, 
shown  in  the  second  level  (boxes  in  Figure  1b).  This 
event stream is represented using an abstract transcript 
format  that  records  actor  and  media  participants  in 
events.  Meaningful events at this level of analysis may 
not  have  a  1-1  correspondence  to  log  file  events.  For 
example, the act of posting a message with previewing 
may show up as multiple GET and POST entries in an 
HTTP log file. 

At  this  level  of  abstraction  (Figure  1b),  we 
compute  contingencies  between  events,  to  produce  a 
model of how acts are mutually contextualized (shown 
as arrows). Human action is contingent upon its setting 
in  diverse  ways:  our  computational  methods  capture 
some  of  these  contingencies  that  are  amenable  to 
automated  detection.  A  contingency  called  proximal 
event reflects the likelihood that events occurring close

together in time and space are related. For example, in 
analyzing  quasi-synchronous  chat,  contingencies  are 
installed  to  prior  contributions  in  the  same  room  that 
occur  within  an  adjustable  time  window  but  not  too 
recently. A Keystroke Level Model [13] of how long a 
typist would have taken to type the contribution is used 
to ensure that the prior contribution was already visible 
when typing began by closing the window this amount 
of  time  before  the  contribution.  Address  and  reply 
contingencies  are 
installed  between  an  utterance 
mentioning  a  user  by  name  and  the  last  contribution 
that 
(address)  and  next  contribution  (reply)  by 
participant  within 
a 
parser/matcher of user IDs to first names. Same actor 
contingencies are installed to prior acts of a participant 
over a larger time window to reflect the continuity of 
an agent’s purpose. Overlap in content as represented 
by  sets  of  lexical  stems  is  used  to  produce  a  lexical 
contingency  weighted  by 
terms 
overlapping.  Semantic  analysis  can  also  be  done,  but 
our research and development strategy is to see how far 
we  can  get  with  these  simpler  contingencies  before 
adding  computational  complexity.  Examples  of 
specific contingencies are given later in the paper. 

time  window,  using 

the  number  of 

The resulting contingency graph (e.g., Figure 1b) 
is represented as the first layer of abstraction in what 
we  call  an  Entity-Event-Contingency  graph  or  EEC 
[19]. In the EEC graph, vertices are Events. These can 
be  of  various  types  (e.g.,  enter  chat,  exit  chat,  chat 
contribution), and are annotated with time stamps and 
optionally  associated  Entities,  which  include  human 
actors, content (e.g., chat content), and locations (e.g., 
chat  rooms)  involved  in  the  event.  Contingencies  are 
typed edges between vertices (the types were described 
in the previous paragraph), and there may be multiple 
edges  between  any  two  vertices  (e.g.,  two  proximal 
events by the same actor with lexical overlap will have 
at least three contingencies between them). 

It  is  necessary  to  collapse  the  multiple  edges 
between  vertices  into  single  edges  for  two  reasons. 
First,  most  graph  algorithms  assume  that  there  is  at 
most only one edge between two vertices. Second, and 
more  importantly,  we  are  interested  in  uptake,  the 
relationship  between  events  in  which  a  human  action 
takes  up  some  aspects  of  prior  events  as  being 
significant in some manner [19]. For example, replying 
to  prior  contributions  in  a  chat  or  discussion  is  an 
example of uptake. Uptake is not specific to a medium 
(it  can  occur  in  different  media,  and  cross  media). 
Uptake is more general than “transactivity” [3] because 
uptake  need  not  be  explicitly  directed  at  a  dyadic 
partner. Contingencies are of interest only as collective 
evidence  for  uptake.  So,  we  abstract  the  contingency 
graph  to  an  uptake  graph,  using  a  weighted  (and 
presently  linear)  combination  of  the  various  types  of

contingencies  between  contributions  (vertices) 
to 
derive  a  single  uptake  relation  represented  as  a  graph 
edge  weighted  to  reflect  strength  of  evidence  in  the 
contingencies.  Different  weights  can  be  used  for 
different purposes (e.g., finding sessions; analyzing the 
interactional structure of sessions).  

As shown in Figure 1c, uptake graphs are similar 
to  contingency  graphs  in  that  they  also  relate  events, 
but  they  collect  together  bundles  of  contingencies 
between a given pair of vertices into uptake relations, 
optionally  filtering  out  low-weighted  bundles.  At  this 
point,  we  can  do  several  interesting  things  with  these 
uptake graphs. A graph clustering algorithm is applied 
to  the  uptake  graph  to  find  clusters  of  related 
contributions  that  we  call  “sessions”  (indicated  by

settings  such  as  chat  rooms.  Inter-session  and  intra-
session analysis proceeds from here.  

inter-session  analysis,  we  collapse  each 
session  into  a  single  vertex  representing  the  session, 
but retain the inter-session uptake links. (For example, 
there  are  four  sessions  in  Figure  1c  and  two  inter-
session  uptakes.)  These  inter-session  links  indicate 
potential  influences  across  time  and  space  from  one 
session to another. An example will be given shortly in 
conjunction with Figure 4.  

For intra-session analysis, the uptake graph for a 
session is isolated. Two paths are possible from here. 
The  sequential  structure  of  the  interaction  can  be 
micro-analyzed  to  understand  the  development  of

group  accomplishments:  this  part  is  not  automated, 
although  future  work  includes  analysis  of  uptake 
patterns in the form of graph configurations to identify 
sessions  with  features  of  interest.  Or  we  can  fold  the 
uptake network into an actor-actor sociogram (directed 
weighted graph), where the tie strength between actors 
is  the  sum  of  the  strength  of  uptake  between  their 
contributions  (Figure  1d).  This  sociogram  can  be 
analyzed  using  conventional  social  network  analysis 
methods  such  as  degree  or  eigenvector  centrality  to 
identify key actors, etc. [12, 23].  

In  summary,  our  framework  provides  multiple 
pathways for analysis, some of which are diagrammed 
in Figure 2. Contingencies are applied to events in the 
EEC  abstract  transcript  to  produce  a  contingency 
graph.  Contingencies  are  then  aggregated  into  uptake 
between the same events. A single aggregation can be 
used,  or  optionally  (as  shown  in  Figure  2)  different 
weightings  can  be  used  for  identifying  sessions  by 
graph partitioning versus for doing detailed interaction 
analysis.  (We  are  currently  studying  whether  it  is 
productive 
these 
purposes.) In either case, uptake that crosses partitions 
can  be  used  to  identify  influences  across  space  and 
time,  and  uptake  within  partitions  can  be  analyzed  to 
study  the  interactional  structure  of  a  session.  Uptake 
graphs  may  be  folded  into  networks  where  nodes  are 
actors  rather  than  events,  to  which  sociometrics  are 
applied.  

to  use  different  weightings  for 

Another line of analysis not discussed in this paper 
is  to  fold  events  into  actor-artifact  networks,  or 
bipartite  weighted  directed  graphs 
that  we  call 
“associograms”  for  short,  because  they  capture  how 
actors  are  associated  with  each  other  via  mutual  read 
and  write  of  media  objects.  In  that  line  of  work,  we 
have  undertaken  community  analysis  of  associograms 
to detect not only human participants in communities, 
but also the artifacts that reflect their mediated nature 
(e.g., synchronous or asynchronous) [20].  
3.  Implementation 
Our  primary  implementation  is  in  Java.  The  core 
implementation  includes  classes  defining  events  and 
entities  that  participate  in  events,  along  with  base 
classes for contingencies that relate events, and a class 
that  collects 
into  EEC  graphs.  Composite 
contingencies  and  composite  events  aggregate  these 
objects to represent uptake and sessions, respectively. 
Domain model classes define specific kinds of entities 
such as actors, chats, discussions, etc., and datasource 
classes  define  how  to  import  log  files  into  these 
representations.  We use the Hibernate object/relational 
model  and  persistence  engine  (hibernate.org/orm)  to

Layered on top of the EEC, analyzer classes define 
workspace objects for specifying and storing analyses, 
classes that run specific analysis steps (e.g., computing 
lexical 
combining 
contingencies  into  uptake,  finding  sessions,  exporting 
graphs), and another class defining scripts that control 
these  steps.  As  exemplified  in  Tables  1  and  2,  XML 
scripts  control  processing,  including  selection  of  type 
and  range  of  source  data  from  the  EEC  (not  shown); 
sequencing of analytic steps (partially shown in Table 
1); and weighting of contingencies (Table 2). We call 
out  to  the  JVM-based  implementation  of  Python 
(www.jython.org)  to  use  the  NLTK  library  (nltk.org) 
for lexical processing, and spawn external processes to 
utilize the iGraph package (igraph.sourceforge.net) for 
graph operations such as graph partitioning. Presently 
we  run  analyses  in  Eclipse  (www.eclipse.org/)  and 
export  results  for  viewing  and  interpretation  in  tools 
such as Gephi (gephi.org).

Here  we  illustrate  the  approach  with  an  analysis  we 
conducted of data from the Tapped In network.

Weights reflect how strongly a contingency evidences uptake (e.g., mentioning someone by name is 
stronger  evidence  than  merely  chatting  soon  after  that  person).  LexicalContingency  is  additionally 
weighted proportional to the number of overlapping lexical stems. Weights are being adjusted through 
experimentation with our data. We do not claim that these weights are the best for other applications.

4.1  Tapped In 

This  study  drew  on  data  from  SRI  International’s 
Tapped  In®  (tappedin.org),  an  international  online 
network  of  educators  involved  in  diverse  forms  of 
informal  and  formal  professional  development  and 
peer  support  [6,  16].  According  to  its  developers, 
Tapped  In  was  motivated  by  the  desire  to  understand 
how  to  initiate  and  manage  large  heterogeneous 
communities  of  educators,  how  such  communities 
evolve,  and  the  benefits  that  participants  derive  from 
their involvement. This network included activities that 
were 
(e.g., 
universities,  school  districts,  and  nonprofits)  mixed 
with volunteer driven and other unsponsored activities, 
in  both  synchronous  and  asynchronous  media,  with 
participants  from  across  all  career  stages  and  diverse 
occupations related to education. Thus, Tapped In is an 
opportunity to develop and test hypotheses, tools, and 
techniques for understanding heterogeneous networks. 
Cumulatively,  Tapped  In  hosted  the  content  and 

formal  organizations

(over 20,000 per year in our study period) in thousands 
of  user-created 
threaded 
discussions, shared files and URLs, text chats, an event 
calendar, and other tools to support collaborative work. 
Over  its  16-year  history,  more  than  50  organizations, 
including education agencies and institutions of higher 
education, consulted with Tapped In staff and became 
“tenants” 
system  with  online  courses, 
workshops,  seminars,  mentoring  programs,  and  other 
collaborative activities. There were also approximately 
40-60 public activities per month designed by Tapped 
In  members  and  open  to  anyone  in  the  community 
(including  tenant  members).  Volunteers  drove  the 
majority  of  Tapped  In  community-wide  activity  [6]. 
Extensive  data  collection  capabilities  captured  the 
activity  of  all  members  and  groups,  including  chat 
data,  discussion  board  interactions,  and  file  sharing. 
The trend in current social media is for such data to be 
treated  as  a  proprietary  asset,  so  the  Tapped  In  data 
corpus offers a valuable opportunity for study.

We  selected  a  period  from  September  2005 
through May 2007 for our research, and used smaller 
samples  within  this  period  to  develop  and  test  our 
methods.  This  period  was  chosen  because  graphs  of 
activity  showed  peak  usage  during  this  time,  and  we 
wanted to study a successful network. (Usage tapered 
off after 2010, and Tapped In was shut down in 2013.) 
Here we report an example analysis of 3 days of data, 
which  includes  a  session  of  particular  interest  in  the 
second  day.  This  session,  a  “Teaching  Teachers” 
session on mentoring, had previously been chosen for 
micro-analysis due to its high quality of interaction. A 
brief  sample  of  the  chat  is  shown  in  Table  3.  We 
wanted  to  test  whether  the  methods  described  above 
would  detect  anything  significant  about  this  session 
and how it was embedded in its surrounding context.  

The first step was to import data from the log files 
into our EEC format. Tapped In log files were in both 
database format and raw text files for chat transcripts: 
custom translators were written to import a sequence of 
events organized by time (boxes in Figure 1b).  
4.2  Contingencies and Uptake 
An  XML  script  drives  the  contingency  and  uptake 
analysis, as discussed previously. Educator chats tend 
to  be  deliberative;  hence,  for  our  data  we  set  the 
window  for  the  Proximal  Event  contingency  at  120 
seconds  before  the  contribution  (Table  1).  Shorter 
durations  have  been  used  for  faster  paced  chats  [15]. 
We  are  initially  using  conservative  parameters  for 
Keystroke Level Modeling, namely expert typist values

limit 

Similar  computations  are  used 

published  in  [13]  of  M=0.6  and  K=0.08,  where  M  is 
the  average  time  for  a  mental  operation  initiating  the 
typing  and  K  is  the  average  time  to  strike  a  key.  For 
example, the contribution by A2 at 23:38 in Table 2 is 
50 characters long: 0.6 + (50*0.08) = 4.6 seconds, so 
this cannot be taking up M’s question at 23:35 (the full 
transcript shows that it continues a prior question). In 
contrast,  M’s  question  is  within  the  proximal  event 
scope  of  A2’s  contribution  at  23:42,  which 
is 
answering  the  question.  Similarly,  the  simultaneous 
contributions  at  24:09  cannot  be  contingent  on  each 
other,  and  25:18  cannot  be  contingent  on  25:17  even 
though D and M are in conversation with each other.   
the 
temporal  scope  of  other  contingencies,  although  a 
larger time window of 300 seconds was used (Table 2). 
An Address Contingency is placed between D’s 24:27 
“That  is  an  interesting  question  M”  and  M’s  prior 
question at 23:35; while a Reply Contingency is placed 
between M’s “… thought about often D” at 24:42 and 
D’s 24:27. All of M’s later contributions are contingent 
on the earlier ones by Same Actor in this short excerpt. 
Although  most  contingencies  are  limited  to  events  in 
the same room, we allow Same Actor to cross rooms. 
Exemplifying  the  Lexical  Contingency,  the  lexical 
stems for A2's contribution at 23:38 (“some people will 
…”)  are  {peopl, 
tak,  get,  point}  and  for  A's 
contribution  at  24:09  (“some  people  are  …”)  are  
{peopl,  excel,  teach,  horr,  ment}.  These  overlap  on 
“peopl”.    (Stop  words  such  as  “some”  have  been 
filtered.  The  “some  people”  similarity  of  wording 
suggests adding a new contingency based on repeated 
bigrams or n-grams.) 
resulting 

have  multiple 
contingencies  between  a  pair  of  events,  and  is  too 
complex  to  visualize  (Figure  1b  offers  a  schematic). 
Many network algorithms can only operate on graphs 
with  a  single  edge  or  arc  between  any  two  vertices 
(nodes), and we want to estimate the extent of uptake 
between acts. Hence, using weights like those in Table 
2, we collapse the multiple contingencies between two 
events  into  a  single  weighted  arc  representing  the 
extent  to  which  the  second  is  related  to  the  first:  the 
uptake  graph  of  Figure  1c.  All  operations  described 
below are on the uptake graph except where noted.  
4.3  Sessions 
The  next  step  was  to  empirically  identify  sessions 
(temporally  contiguous  interactions  between  a  set  of 
actors)  in  the  uptake  graph.  Although  Tapped  In  had 
scheduled “calendar events” where participants met in 
a particular room at a particular time, there were also 
many  other  sessions  that  took  place  spontaneously  or 
were  not  announced  in  the  calendar,  and  sometimes

that  actually 

even  formal  events  would  move  between  rooms. 
Therefore,  we  sought  to  empirically  identify  the 
sessions 
took  place.  We  compared 
algorithms 
for  detection  of  cohesive  subgraphs 
(“community detection algorithms”, [7]), applied to the 
uptake graph to identify sessions. A future publication 
will report the relative merits of several algorithms and 
the  definitions  of  “session”  that  they  imply.  The 
example  reported  here  used  a  modularity  partitioning 
algorithm  [4]  implemented  in  iGraph,  which  implies 
that sessions are partitions of the uptake graph that are 
more  highly  connected  within  each  partition  than 
expected  at  random  [12].  Modularity  partitioning  can 
find clusters of activity even when there is continuous 
activity resulting in a weakly connected uptake graph. 
However,  when  sessions  have  clear  beginnings  and 
ends  without  overlap  (i.e.,  contingencies  do  not  span 
the  gaps), 
connected 
components is sufficient.  

finding  weakly 

simply 

In  Figure  3  we  show  the  uptake  graph  for  the 
three-day  period.  All  visualizations  are  in  Gephi 
(gephi.org,  [2]).  This  particular  visualization  uses  the 
OpenOrd layout algorithm [10], a hierarchical version 
of  traditional  force-directed  algorithms  that  group 
nodes according to their interconnectedness. Nodes are 
individual chat or discussion contributions, and colors 
represent the modularity partitions.  

Each  colored  connected  cluster  corresponds  to  a 
session. The visualization made clear that there were a 
surprising  number  of  interactive  sessions  taking  place 
in Tapped In over this three-day period: there are 112 
partitions. Interestingly, some sessions crossed rooms: 
sometimes a “tour” would start in one room and move 
to others, or persons would meet in the Reception room 
and  then  move  elsewhere.  Although  we  find  it  to  be 

interesting  and  sometimes  useful  to  inspect  them, 
visualizations such as Figure 3 are in general difficult 
to interpret, so we use computational tools for further 
analysis as follows.  
4.4  Inter-Session Relations and Key Sessions 

After  finding  modularity  partitions  of  the  activity 
graph, the analysis can take two paths, as was shown in 
Figure 2. Within a session, analysis of uptake structure 
between contributions and (by folding) between actors 
helps us understand interaction and roles, respectively. 
Analysis  of  uptake  between  sessions  is  of  interest  for 
understanding  how  actors  and  ideas  move  between 
settings  across  time  and  space  in  a  socio-technical 
system. Both of these paths are exemplified below.  

Figure  4  shows  the  session  graph,  where  the 
contributions  of  each  of  the  112  sessions  have  been  
collapsed  into  a  single  node.  Weights  on  edges 
crossing sessions were summed, and the weighted in-
degree for each session is shown as node size. Several 
of  the  sessions  have  larger  node  size,  indicating  their 
apparent 
influences  on  subsequent  sessions.  Of 
particular interest is the larger pink session node with a 
large  green  arrow  pointing  to  it  from  a  smaller  light 
green  session  node  (inset).  What  is  the  relationship 
between  these  sessions?  First  we  examined  the  pink 
session, the chronologically prior session being “taken 
up” by the later one.  
4.5  Session Example 
It turned out that the modularity partition visualized as 
the  large  pink  node  almost  exactly  captured  the 

1702

in 

in 

the 
Teaching  Teachers  session  on  mentoring 
schools. The events placed in this partition included all 
of  the  Teaching  Teachers  session  contributions,  and 
only  a  few  other  events  in  other  locations  at  the 
beginning and end (from the Same Actor contingency). 
Events in this partition included initial entries into the 
Teaching  Teachers  room  and  introductions,  followed 
by an in depth discussion of peer mentoring of teachers 
in schools (excerpted in Table 3), facilitated by M and 
lasting nearly an hour. Near the end, M mentions that 
she  needs  to  leave  for  another  discussion,  and  the 
others  thank  her  and  say  goodbye.  Interestingly,  the 
modularity-partitioning  algorithm  placed 
this 
session the first few utterances of M showing up in the 
new  session  in  another  room,  which  we  shall  call  an 
“In Training” group.  

On  inspection,  we  found  that  other  partitions  in 
this  case  study,  as  well  as  dozens  of  partitions  from 
runs  on  other  space-time  spans  of  data,  also 
corresponded  to  sessions  with  clear  interpretations  as 
to the boundaries and purpose of the gathering. This is 
remarkable because the partitions were derived purely 
with  algorithmic  methods:  no 
information  about 
sessions  was  provided  to  the  algorithms.  Thus  the 
method  shows  promise  as  an  automated  way  of 
identifying meaningful social events.  
4.6  Inter-Session Relations 
As  visualized  in  our  graphs,  uptake  arcs  are  drawn 
from the chronologically later event to the prior event 
being  taken  up,  and  the  same  is  true  of  the  collapsed 
session  graph  in  Figure  4.  What  is  the  nature  of  the 
session that is the source of the large green arrow in the 
inset of Figure 4, i.e., that it depends on the session we 
just examined? Looking at the event sequence for this 
session, we found that it is the In Training session that 
the  facilitator  M  has  just  joined.  Furthermore,  two  of 
the  participants  in  her  previous  Teaching  Teachers 
session,  A2  and  L,  followed  her  there.  This  is  the 
reason  for  the  thickness  (weight)  of  the  green  arrow: 
three actors have moved from one session to another, 
resulting  in  Same  Actor  contingencies  connecting  the 
sessions.  This  relationship  suggests  that  it  might  be 
fruitful  to  see  whether  any  ideas  discussed  in  the 
Teaching  Teachers  session  were  carried  over  to  In 
Training.  
4.7  Intra-Session Analysis of Key Actors 
A  preliminary  analysis  of  the  uptake  structure  of  the 
Teaching Teachers session is reported in [18]. Here we 
focus  on  the  sociogram  level  of  analysis  (Figure  1d). 
Folding the uptake graph for this session into an actor-
actor  sociogram,  we  obtained  the  graph  shown  in

Figure 5. Node size is weighted in-degree, showing the 
relative importance of actors in terms of the extent to 
which  we  estimate 
their 
contributions. (Eigenvector centrality can also be used 
to estimate transitive importance.) Not surprisingly, the 
most  uptake  was  from  contributions  by  the  session 
leader  M.  Inspecting  user  profiles  and  prior  activity, 
we  found  that  participant  L  was  an  experienced 
member  who  sometimes  facilitated  her  own  sessions. 
Additionally,  the  sociogram  helped  us  notice  the 
importance  of  other  actors:  A,  A2,  D  and  E.  A2  was 
trying  out  Tapped  In  for  her  first  time,  and  it  seems 
significant that she followed M into the next session.  
5.  Discussion 
5.1  Summary and Applications 
This paper outlined an analytic approach in which log 
events are abstracted and merged into a single abstract 
transcript  of  events 
series  of 
representations are derived that support multiple levels 
of  analysis  of  interaction  (contingency  and  uptake 
graphs, and session graphs) and of ties (associograms 
and  sociograms).  An  example  illustrated  how  our 
analytic framework and supporting algorithms can (1) 
find 
the 
relatively unstructured medium of chats; (2) parse the 
stream  of  activity  into  sessions  defined  as  densely 
connected  clusters  of  activity  based  on 
these 
relationships;  (3)  make  influences  between  sessions 
across 
time  and  space  visible;  and  (4)  enable 
sociometric analysis of individual sessions.

sessions.  Tapped  In  community  managers  (personal 
communication) have indicated that, due to the volume 
of  activity  and 
the  mixture  of  sponsored  and 
unsponsored  events,  they  could  not  keep  track  of 
everything  taking  place  in  their  environment,  and 
would have benefited from knowing about and offering

these

discussions,  although  some  rules  for  generating 
contingencies will need to be rewritten to acknowledge 
the  different  temporality  of  asynchronous  discussion 
and  to  leverage  other  information  such  as  thread 
structure  and  quotation  practices  [1].  We  have  begun 
such a generalization with Tapped In data, and plan to 
integrate  it  with  the  chat  analysis  for  cross-media 
analysis.  
5.2  Contributions 

since 

Our  work  addresses  two  analytic  challenges  arising 
from  the  nature  of  participation  in  socio-technical 
networks.  First, 
learning  and  knowledge 
production  in  socio-technical  networks  takes  place 
through  a  synergistic  mixture  of 
individual  and 
collective  agency,  we  need  to  understand  aggregate 
phenomenon (e.g., “ties”, “roles”, and “communities”) 
as  both  produced  by  and  providing  the  setting  of 
specific interactional events. Our framework addresses 
this  with  linked  abstractions  that  coordinate  multiple 
levels  of  analysis.  Second,  participant  interaction  is 
distributed  across  media,  places  and  time  in  these 
environments, potentially resulting in separate traces of 
interaction that fragment their unitary experience. Our 
framework  addresses  this  by  building  on  an  abstract 
transcript of interaction.  

Algorithms for cohesive sub-cluster detection have 
been  used  extensively  in  studying  socio-technical 
networks  [7],  but  usually  on  graphs  of  ties  between 
actors. Our innovation is to apply cohesive sub-cluster 
detection  to  graphs  of  relationships  between  events 
(such  as  chat  contributions)  to  find  “communities”  of 
events in a time-space matrix; that is, sessions. Once a 

1704

on 

for 

session is identified, we can fold the session graph into 
a sociogram of ties between actors. Others have done 
this  as  well  using  temporal  proximity  (e.g.,  Rosen  & 
Corbit  [15]),  but  we  also  consider  other  relations 
between  events  to  provide  a  richer  basis  for  session 
identification  and  subsequent  analysis  of  activity  and 
actors  within  sessions.  Work  by  Trausan-Matu  on 
“polyphonic analysis” [22] has affinities to our use of 
multiple  contingencies,  but  has  only  recently  been 
abstracted  to  higher  levels  of  analysis.  A  thesis  by 
Charles [5] has provided an alternative implementation 
of our approach and extended the set of contingencies. 
Our approach dovetails with work that applies natural 
language  processing  methods  for  syntactic,  semantic 
and  pragmatic  analysis  of  interactional  structure,  and 
indeed  rules  for  generating  additional  contingencies 
could be derived from such research.  
5.3  Future Work 
At this writing, oingoing work includes experimenting 
with  different  algorithms  for  identifying  sessions, 
testing  other  promising  contingencies,  and  tuning 
weights 
the 
interactional structure of sessions. Once these are well 
grounded,  we  can  study  how  patterns  of  uptake  and 
metrics  on  the  derived  sociograms  relate  to  session 
quality, and use these to automatically identify sessions 
of interest. Two other near-term concerns include using 
inter-session relationships to trace the spread of ideas, 
and incorporating analysis of asynchronous discussions 
for analysis of cross-media influences.

Looking further ahead, automating the generation 
of  interaction  and  social  network  graphs  opens  up 
several  new  research  approaches  for  relating  fine-
grained  interaction  to  more  aggregated  levels  of 
analysis.  One  approach  is  to  generate  multiple  social 
networks  during  a  session,  and  track  the  change  in 
actors’ 
reciprocity, 
clustering  coefficient,  and  centrality)  in  order  to 
recognize significant changes to the group structure or 
individual role emergence. We could also automate the 
generation  of  social  network  graphs  at  significant 
points  over 
the  online 
environment, 
interacting 
individuals and track the growth and fragmentation of 
overlapping  communities.  It  might  be  possible  to 
identify  changes  in  sociometrics  that  signal  critical 
points  in  the  formation  of  healthy  or  unhealthy 
communities.

ABSTRACT
Public librarians face various factors that can affect profes-
sional practice: socio-cultural nuances of diverse information
needs, isolation due to system-wide location and/or geogra-
phy, and systemic disconnection from professional network-
ing and learning opportunities. To address these factors, an
inquiry-based professional development model called The
Librarians’
Inquiry Forum (LINQ) was devised and employed
with a select group of Hawai’i-based public librarians via the
cloud-based collaborative workspace platform, Slack, as a
means of building a community-of-practice for professional
learning and development. This article reports the evolution
and early implementation of the LINQ model. Inquiry-based
research often reveals data that raises more questions than
answers. Questions raised from the reflective research per-
formed with LINQ revealed ways in which the LINQ librarians
learned “better” ways/approaches of practice. LINQ was
found to be a viable method for enhancing public librarian
professional development.

Introduction

One of the ongoing concerns in Library and Information Science (LIS)
research and discourse is that there is an inconsistency (and sometimes
absence) in teaching pre-service librarian competencies and inquiry
focusing on servicing diverse populations, which includes cultural and
mobility-based communities. Diversity topics are necessary in today’s
world and need to be included in LIS curriculum so that pre-service
librarians learn how to competently service vulnerable populations such
as homeless citizens, homeschooled students and parents, immigrants,
and disabled patrons (Reardon 2016; Westbrook 2015). In LIS, such
competencies are framed by the theories of cultural competency, equi-
table access, community engagement, and inquiry-based research (Irvin
2016; Mestre 2010).

Triangulating the ideas of cultural competency with equitable access
and community engagement underscored with a reflective inquiry-based
approach allows librarians, and public librarians, specifically, to methodi-
cally identify professional practices that work and don’t work, to share
professional experiences that need to be heard and supported, to reflect
on one another’s stories for professional learning and development. This
research asks the question: “In what ways can public librarians learn from
one another in real-time interaction via online communications, for pro-
fessional development?” In short, what happens when, amid active “busy”
days serving the public, the public librarian receives support from collea-
gues via a post or comment, or discussion thread, or receives much
needed information in the moment from a colleague via a resource or
artifact that is shared within a community of practice convened online,
accessible as easily as a tab on one’s web browser, or via a notification
from the online platform’s application installed on one’s mobile device?
To begin exploration of this question, we collaborated with the Hawai’i
State Public Library System (HSPLS) to convene a select group of public
librarians, working across the six inhabited islands of Hawai’i, as a commu-
nity of practice, using the cloud-based collaborative workspace platform
Slack (http://www.slack.com). Branded as LINQ: The Librarians’ Inquiry
Forum, narrative data from librarian participation in discussions on Slack
revealed ways in which public librarians can systematically use social net-
working and/or social media to technologically mediate professional colla-
boration and learning across physical and social distance to enhance
professional practice and service towards diverse communities seeking cul-
turally and socially competent service at the public library.

Contextualizing the complexities of a nuanced paradise
The Hawai’i State Public Library System (HSPLS), boasts 50 locations across six
islands, where branch libraries are often distal from one another, across swaths
of rural and mountainous landscapes (hawaiilibraries.org). Small and rural
library locations are often a one-librarian show, with a small supportive para-
professional staff. Case in point, within the HSPLS, where our research was
conducted, most of the librarians participating in LINQ work in rural locations
where they were the only librarian on staff. One librarian had just one other staff
member working the entire library with her, at the end tip of one of the
Hawaiian Islands. Another librarian was working split-time between two rural
locations located within 15 miles of one another. Lastly, there were two LINQ
librarians and each served an entire island where there is only one public library.
What is unique and specific to the HSPLS is that the library system is
situated within an indigenous culture that is marginalized in some ways
(historically and socio-economically) and privileged in others (tourism).

This dichotomy begs the question of agency for library and information
services for the everyday citizenry, which in Hawai’i is incredibly diverse.
To tease out the complexities and nuances of Hawai’i-based norms (local)
alongside Hawaiian cultural values (indigenous) is a tall order for public
librarians on the frontlines of public service across the islands.

The State of Hawai’i’s organization, infrastructure, and administration is
consistent with the mainland American framework. Indeed, there is a normative
presentation of “library” that is akin to public libraries across the swath of
geography on the mainland United States. Secondly, in Hawai’i, due to the
historical coming together of many peoples from many places during the
transition of Hawai’i from a sovereign monarchical nation to an occupied U.S.
territory to a state of the U.S., the population is intensely diverse, which includes
multiple Asian cultural groups (Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Thai), a
multicultural presence of Polynesian/Oceanic groups
(Fijian, Maorian,
Melanesian, Samoan, Tongan), Latino (Mexican, Portuguese, Puerto Rican),
Euro and African Americans (predominantly from the universities and military
bases), and most importantly of all, the Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians), many
who are descendants of the original Polynesian settlers of the Hawaiian Islands
(McDermott and Andrade 2011).

Due to the fact that Hawai’i is the most diverse state in the country (Welch
2011), HSPLS’s librarians are concerned with professional practices that must
meet diverse needs, in isolated locations across the state within a framework
that is multilayered with Asian and Polynesian values and aesthetics orbited
by mainstream American hegemonic character.

Literature review: Framing the agency of public librarian practice
Since Hawai’i’s diversity is embedded as a natural status of its local culture,
we wanted to learn, in what ways was this diversity addressed in the HSPLS
librarians’ approaches and practices within their service communities, and
with one another as colleagues and neighbors across islands? LINQ: The
Librarians’ Inquiry Forum was designed to serve as a reflective space where
HSPLS librarians could decrease physical and social isolation from town to
town, island to island, so that even though separate geographically, they
could still connect, interact, share, and learn from one another in real-time,
with the convenience of a social networking technology. Therefore, the
conceptual framework for this research was guided by the following concepts:
librarian identity, librarian practice, and librarian inquiry.

Librarian identity

With this dearth of LIS study and research on the topic of diversity, it follows
that there may be a lack of reflective attention to the formation of an overall

Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 17:43 26 December 2017 4

V. IRVIN AND W. REILE

professional identity for practicing librarians. Lack of reflective study creates an
important question: What is the identity of the professionally trained librarian?
In what ways is one’s cultural heritage, ethnicity, mobility, and socioeconomic
status an aspect of the formation of professionalism for public librarians? What
is the LIS curricula’s goal for educating and producing “librarians”?

These questions are important because LIS as a profession is quite homo-
genous with an 88% white female population (ALA Office for Diversity 2012).
Yet within this homogeneity, there is diversity in cultural heritage and various
identities connected with gender, mobility, and socioeconomic status. However,
these diversities are not typically unpacked in the LIS classroom (Irvin 2016;
Kumasi and Manlove 2015), let alone in LIS practice. Pointedly, in this study, the
librarian participants consisted of 15 females and 1 male, of which eight were
Asian, five were European-descent Americans, and two were of Native Hawaiian
heritage. Thus, it is within the information need of a wholistic professional
identity construction that LINQ model is designed to address.

Librarian practice

For the LINQ project, we posit that librarian professional practice is an
ongoing,
iterative habitus of LIS values acquired from LIS education.
Librarians learn the ethos and values for librarianship in library school. LIS
values echo the American core values of freedom, democracy, and fairness
(Rodger 1998) with a commitment to open and equal access to information,
unbiased customer service, and activation of community voice within library
activities. While these values are part of a librarian’s professional heritage, the
application of them may complement a person’s personal values, but can also
counter one’s personal perspective, as well (Rodger 1998). It is in library
school where these ideological tensions are discussed and reflected upon as
part of the process of becoming a LIS professional.

The question then becomes the following one: “Beyond library school, in what
ways does librarian professional practice shift over the course of a career to
reflect LIS ethics and values in heightened, wiser ways, based on a synthesis with
professional experiences?” I believe this question is a crucial lifelong learning
question and stance for effective professional practices of librarians—particu-
larly librarians who serve the public to promote the public good. LINQ opens up
space for practicing librarians to keep conversations happening that address
their questions about practice and that serve as a checks and balance for ethical
practices. LINQ’s design allows practice to become a point of critical inquiry.

Librarian inquiry

Although librarians answer questions as a foundational aspect of their pro-
fessional practice, one problematic epistemological issue is this idea that

Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 17:43 26 December 2017 PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY

5

librarians “know it all” and therefore have no questions to ask or ponder or
need support in unpacking. Librarians often have questions about funding,
best practices in dealing with challenging patrons, how to best engage their
service community, as well as concerns about staff relations, professional
development and networking. One study investigating public librarians’
reader response to library books in a book club revealed that librarians
often feel “fragile” about the questions and challenges they experience within
their daily work (Irvin Morris 2012). Librarians often don’t feel trusting to
ask challenging or critical questions in fear of professional reprisal and/or
citizen confrontation (Irvin Morris 2012). Questions,
librarians do have.
They also have the need to collaboratively discuss and share these questions
and ideas as a means of learning from one another in order to “do better”
(Lytle 2008; Moreillon, Cahill, and McKee 2012).

A focus on improving services to library patrons is the goal of librarian
professional development. As librarians, we point people into the directions
they need to seek answers to their questions. In turn, to continuously
improve our practice, we must ask ourselves (and one another) questions
about what we are doing and why we are doing what we are doing, and if
what we are doing truly is contributing to the public good not just for the
citizenry, but for ourselves as members of that same citizenry. LINQ seeks to
remedy the problem of librarians feeling fragile when outwardly providing
service, by creating space for them to collaboratively look within, in the spirit
of mutual support, for professional learning and development.

Methodology: Forming the librarians’ inquiry forum (LINQ)

LINQ embraces practitioner inquiry as a means of situated socio-profes-
sional learning for public librarians who are geographically disconnected/
isolated from one another within the same library system or within the
same practice of librarianship (i.e., public, school, special/archival, and
academic libraries). Utilizing the cloud-based collaborative workspace plat-
form, Slack (http://www.slack.com), LINQ addresses the isolation factor
(that continues to be a challenging aspect of librarian professional practice
in the public sector (Kelley, Rapp, and Warburton 2011)), by organizing
public librarians from the most isolated place on earth, Hawai’i, into an
online community of practice. The methodology for LINQ began with a
year-long pilot study whose data informed us on how to best design LINQ
as a strategically effective forum for at-work networking and collaboration.

“The patron stance”: Pilot study
To familiarize ourselves with the geographic context of Hawai’i’s public libraries
within HSPLS, we conducted a one-year explorative tour of all the HSPLS

V. IRVIN AND W. REILE

libraries on the island of O’ahu to learn about public library services within a
Hawai’i-based context that is a mix of global diversity, Polynesian indigeneity,
and mainstream American character. Our tour involved visiting all 25 branch
locations across the island, plus one independently-run public library (Hawai’i
State Public Library System, 2015). For each visit (at a minimum of 90 minutes),
we were focused on three major components as our “library experience”: access,
services, and aesthetics.

The outcomes from the themes of “access” and “aesthetics” were confor-
mational of our expectations as insider/outsider visitors (considering our
professional identities as a degreed LIS practitioner/educator and doctoral
level information science researcher). We determined that HSPLS’s care,
service, and regard for disabled patrons, elderly patrons, and children is
appropriate and did give us a unique sense of Hawai’i-based social mores
within library services. However, outcomes from the theme of “services” gave
rise to the question: “How are the librarians doing?” because our experiences
with asking reference questions to librarians varied from excellent to worri-
some, with a heavy lean towards “worrisome.” While most librarians we
interacted with were welcoming and excellent in their professional knowl-
edge and service, there were some librarians who were curt and others who
appeared disaffected by our presence. For example, when we asked one
librarian a reference question, the response was: “Google it” (Irvin and
Reile, pilot study field notes, February 11, 2016). We weren’t sure if varied
responses to our presence were intellectually charged, or if we were treated
with unnecessary caution/trepidation due to other factors such as race (one
researcher is African American, the other German American, which bespeaks
of a tense racial history with Whites in Hawai’i) (McDermott and Andrade
2011), gender (women), size (one is plus-sized, one is a marathon runner), or
a host of other undetermined reasons/issues.

Nevertheless,

if we subtract

the “familiar” (or personal) from the
“strange” (or (mis)understandable) (Miner 1956; Tavares 2008) we can
place a disaffected librarian anywhere on the planet. Thus, “Google It”
could have (and probably does) happened anywhere. Therefore, we become
concerned about what is happening with library services coming from
degreed librarians, because if the professional training of librarians is not
enough to override dispositions that are seemingly tired, disaffected, or
burned out, then we want to make meaning out of the library experience of
librarians. We want to inquire profoundly to ask, critique, share, debate,
and realize a heightened understanding of what public librarians are experi-
encing in their daily work, because their experiences inescapably impact the
people they serve.

LINQ+HSPLS: Implementing an online community-of-practice for librarian
inquiry

Part of our implementation planning involved our ultimately visiting as
many of the 50 libraries within the HSPLS system as possible, so that we
could gain a fuller understanding of the contexts within which the participat-
ing LINQ+HSPLS librarians were involved, statewide. By the end of 2016,
we’d visited 34 of the 50 HSPLS branches (68%), which included all of O’ahu
(23), Kaua’i (4 of the six branches there), Maui (3 of the 6 branches, plus a
bookmobile), Hawai’i-the Big Island (2 of the 12), and Lānaʻi (1 library on
the island). Additionally, we’d visited the independently-run Makiki
Community Library on O’ahu, for a total of 35 public libraries visited.

Slack was chosen as the collaborative workspace platform for LINQ+HSPLS
for a few reasons: 1) its acronym explains the efficacy for using Slack as a
workplace-oriented site for a community of practice: “Searchable Log of All
Conversation and Knowledge”; 2) the affordances of the platform allows users to
engage with one another easily; and 3) our interviews with LINQ+HSPLS
librarians revealed that many of them had trepidations about using more
popular social networks like Facebook; they felt that Slack offered a more
anonymous, “safer space” for online discourse that was professional in nature,
due to Slack’s documented purpose and use as a workplace “social network
where we spend our workdays” (Locke 2016, para. 2).

Lastly, Slack was chosen for building LINQ+HSPLS as an inquiry-based
online community of practice because it is searchable, allowing for retro-
active access to discourse and artifacts for reflective inquiry and learning.
Also, Slack offers integration of various applications into the platform such as
email, Google Drive, Twitter, YouTube, analytic tracking capability, etc., and
the importance of the platform being available as a downloadable application
on any mobile device (i.e., cell phone, tablet, desktop) enhanced the plat-
form’s accessibility and usability. It was important for testing the sustain-
ability of the group that methods for sharing all information could be in one
place, and Slack affords that ability (Figure 1).

LINQ+HSPLS design
Seventeen librarians across the state of Hawai’i were identified by the Hawai’i
State Librarian (who heads up the HSPLS) to participate in LINQ. The
participants were all “Branch Librarians,” which means they were all man-
agers or head librarian of the locations where they worked. The LINQ
+HSPLS librarians typically led a staff of 2–24 people, depending on where
they were located. The LINQ+HSPLS librarians hailed from the following
islands: Kaua’i: 2; O’ahu: 8; Lānaʻi: 1; Maui: 2; and Big Isle (Hawai’i): 4, for a
total of 17 initial participants.

Figure 1. LINQ+HSPLS slack interface.

Only one librarian declined participation at the onset of the project: her
apology was that she was just too busy. The remaining 16 librarians were
asked to register and log on to Slack, free of charge, to orient themselves to
Slack’s interface. Semi-structured interviews were conducted during site visits
to each librarian’s work location (except for two interviews conducted via
Skype), and were audio-recorded with permission.

LINQ+HSPLS was a 10-month program which began on September 1, 2016,
and ended on June 30, 2017. During the initializing phase (months 1–3), weekly
inquiry questions were posted in Slack channels by the principal investigator to
allow the librarians to become acquainted with one another, and to learn the
value of participating in inquiry-based research in real-time, online, during
work. At the end of the third month of LINQ+HSPLS, one librarian withdrew
from the project. When asked during a brief exit interview as to why the decision
to leave LINQ+HSPLS, the response was, “I’m just too busy.” This “busy-ness”
then became a coded category for us to explore amongst the remaining 15
librarians: What does “busy” mean for the public librarian? How does “busy”
play a role in engaging or disengaging professional learning and development?
After four months of mediated discussion, Slack analytics revealed five
librarians as the most active “writers” (with the remaining participants
“reading”), with three of them starting to ask inquiry-based questions within
discussion threads (topics) and channels (forums). Instead of waiting for a
prompt from the facilitator, these librarians began setting topics and asking
prompting inquiry questions, such as the following ones:

● What did you learn from the institute you attended? How do they

“harness community knowledge”?

● How do you define Query?

Downloaded by [University of Hawaii at Manoa] at 17:43 26 December 2017 PUBLIC LIBRARY QUARTERLY

9

● What do you wish you learned in library school? Did you learn it? Do

you teach it to your staff? Still waiting for training?

The fourth month, therefore, ushered in the sustainability phase of the
group. The principal investigator contacted the leading participants to ask if
they would be interested to lead discussion for a month. This approach was
crucial in determining the efficacy of LINQ’s design: Is LINQ sustainable
with librarians facilitating their own inquiry group? How will they promote
and sustain interest with one another? In what ways will they sustain this
group? We felt the design would be successful if at least three librarians
independently sustained the group for three consecutive months. Three
LINQ+HSPLS librarians did commit to rotating group facilitation.

Results and discussion

LINQ+HSPLS reader/writer activity on slack

At the beginning of LINQ+HSPLS, there was a higher number of individuals
who were only reading posts and not responding. We attribute this usage to
librarians reducing their learning curve of Slack. Case in point, the only time
all 16 participants were on the platform was at the beginning of the study
when they were registering and orienting themselves with the interface.
During month #2, at four instances 10 participants were on the platform at
one time reading posts. Starting month #4, there was a spike in librarians
reading posts, and over the following four months there were five instances
where there were eight readers on the platform.

Overall, channel participation stayed consistent over ten months. The
highest number of postings for one day totaled 95 messages, which occurred
at the beginning of study, potentially explainable by questions related to
navigating Slack. Typically, channel activity never exceeded more than 30
posts/comments on any given day, across the entire length of the study
(Figure 2).

There were typically eight librarians reading posts at any one time on the
platform. Five users participated intermittently. Factors such as disinterest, a
personally high technological learning curve, and a reluctance to participate
in the study could be potential explanations for the users not engaging with
the platform. The level of engagement rose to its highest numbers after
month #4, which indicates that for online inquiry-based groups, it may
take about four months to establish a sustainable community of practice.

Additionally, the librarians were private messaging each other quite often.
Out of 1,900 messages for LINQ+HSPLS over a nine-month period, 394
messages were sent directly between the librarians, accounting for 23% of all
LINQ+HSPLS Slack activity. This is an interesting data point, mainly due to

the aspect that even within a private, anonymized community of practice, the
librarians still engaged in private interactions away from the group.

LINQ+HSPLS engagement with practitioner inquiry

From the interviews, there were some common concerns that librarians were
keen to discuss such as homelessness, programming, and reference services.
These concerns were interpreted as questions for inquiry. These questions
were posted by the principal investigator/facilitator to Slack in the form of
private “channels”. An example of a channel topic for reference questions
was as follows: “What is your most asked query these days? How has the
query impacted your practice?”

When the group entered the sustainability phase, one librarian moderator
created a channel to discuss “favorite resources” to which she stated the
purpose as follows: “Share the resources you have found to help others
expand their learning opportunities. Could be blogs/websites/books, etc.”
Another librarian moderator posted a channel to discuss staff training:
“How do you train your staff at all levels? What kind of resources do you
wish were provided to help you train your staff? Are there any in-house
training materials that you’ve created and are willing to share?” Lastly, a third
librarian moderator, during her month of sustaining the group, created and
posted a channel to discuss the librarians’ “wish list”: “What’s on your
library’s wishlist [sic]? Is it furniture, programs, staff, policies? What would
it take to make those things happen?” As librarians became comfortable with
collaboratively interacting as a community of practice, they became more
interested and invested in the value of inquiry topics they wanted to engage.
Another data point for LINQ+HSPLS engagement is that the librarians
emailed the principal investigator requesting topics to discuss, complete with a
topical inquiry question. During the sustainable phase, one of the facilitating

11

librarians emailed to request three channels to be created for discussion, even
though it was not her month to facilitate. The principal investigator responded
suggesting adding administration privileges back to the librarian so that she can
freely enter the sustainable aspect of the group to add topics as she sees fit.

Engagement is an indicator of a reflective stance on the part of the participants
in a practitioner inquiry group (Lytle 1996). Librarians asking questions of their
own practice as a contribution to a communal, collaborative discourse is the
edifying impetus upon which LINQ+HSPLS thrives. Librarians become “active
and reflective, as constructors of their own professional practice and generators as
well as users of knowledge” (Lytle 1996). LINQ+HSPLS librarians are system-
atically, yet organically (at any time of the day or night, at work and beyond),
collecting, analyzing, and interpreting shared data from their work sites. Many
artifacts have been shared within the group, from pictures of their library collec-
tions and rooms, from documents to help one another plan programs, make
decisions, co-interpret organizational policies, and manage staff, to forms lost by
one participant and found and shared by another participant across islands, within
minutes.

Conclusion: Outcomes and onward questions

It is evident from the measured pace of engagement, as reported by our data
analysis of user participation, that the LINQ+HSPLS librarians learned from
one another. In various ways, practitioner inquiry via an accessible online
social network, benefitted librarian professional identity and practice. To
revisit our framing research question: “What happens when, amid active
days serving the public, we receive support from a post or thread or artifact
that is shared in a community of practice convened on cloud-based colla-
borative workspace platform?”, we could identify a few early, meaningful
outcomes emergent from LINQ+HSPLS, as follows:

● LINQ+HSPLS was sustainable by the librarians for four consecutive
months. Thus, LINQ is proving to be a useful, meaningful model for
ongoing professional
learning and development for public librarians
working in large library systems and/or practicing in isolated areas be
they rural or urban, geographic or virtual.

● The librarians learned how to navigate a new cloud-based collaborative
workspace platform (where they can use that knowledge to help library
users).

● The librarians learned how to collaboratively build an online community

to engage one another for co-constructive professional development.

● The librarians learned how to make their group sustainable by making
LINQ a part of their daily routine so that critical inquiry into their

V. IRVIN AND W. REILE

professional practice became data for collaborative professional learning
concurrent with their professional practice.

These early outcomes of LINQ+HSPLS’s activities and experiences
underscore the case for ways in which social networks can be put to
best use as a learning tool for inquiry-based professional development.
Case in point, the LINQ+HSPLS librarians were (and continue to be, as
of this writing) engaged in continuous learning due to the socio-profes-
sional discourse of their inquiry group, mediated, in a sustainable way,
online.

As an inquiry-based collaboration model, LINQ focuses on the power of
questions for critical engagement and collaborative learning; thus, our dis-
cussion concludes with considering ongoing questions that the qualitative
data is projecting. Some questions include the following ones: How are the
“readers” on LINQ using the information shared, as opposed to the “writers”
who are more active in leading and sustaining the group? In other words, in
what ways are the members in the pews experiencing LINQ as opposed to the
choir?

Additionally, some data patterns are emerging that we want to code and
analyze. One pattern we’re excited to unpack is this notion of “busy.” Many
of the LINQ+HSPLS librarians (at least 6) stated they were “too busy” or “so
busy” to apologize for low LINQ participation or for struggles in responding
to LINQ contact (i.e., email, phone calls, being mentioned on Slack). Indeed,
“busy” was the reason for two librarians withdrawing from the group early
on. Thus, our question is: What does it mean for a public librarian to be “too
busy”? Is the “busy” due to administrative obligations? Or community needs?
In what ways does (or can) inquiry-based networking (e.g., LINQ) help to
un-busy the “busy”?

four of

Another pattern that leaves us with questions is the notion of librarians
being “not savvy” with technology. About
the LINQ+HSPLS
librarians shared in their interviews that they were leery to try Slack,
that they “don’t do social media.” However, after our site visits where
we worked one-on-one with some of the librarians to teach them Slack, all
participants have been engaged on Slack, except for one librarian. Thus,
the question for “no savvy” becomes: What does it mean to “don’t do
online professional development at work” whether you know how to
interface with the platform or not? We want to learn and document
various ways in which librarians, as information professionals,
learn
from online community building and sharing for professional develop-
ment. We believe that LINQ has a strong narrative to contribute to LIS
discourse to improve professional development
initiatives for public
librarians who are often understaffed and under-resourced for learning
opportunities beyond their daily work. Replicable anywhere, we continue

our research with LINQ to unveil librarian narratives embedded within
inquiry-based questions so that we all can learn from one another in
order to better our practice.

ABSTRACT
To investigate the role of strategic political communication in governing,
this study comprehensively examined presidential agenda-building associa-
tions at three levels during the first six months of U.S. president Barack
Obama’s second term. Multiple presidential information subsidies, national
news content, and policymaking activity were monitored. The results
revealed solid support for all three levels of agenda-building (i.e., object
salience, attribute salience, and network associations among objects or
attributes), but the linkages with media coverage and policymaking were
not uniform across information subsidy types. Based on the analysis, pre-
sidential news releases, blog posts, and presidential speeches were the
most effective all-around strategic agenda-building tools for media man-
agement and policymaking purposes during this time period. The theore-
tical and practical implications are discussed.

The influence of strategic communication in politics via governing has received some scholarly
attention (Avery & Graham, 2013), but our theoretical and empirical knowledge of its role is
underdeveloped when compared to other areas of political communication scholarship (Jackson,
2010). Although the use of political public relations in practice is longstanding, more concerted
efforts to apply and build strategic communication theory within the field is new (Strömbäck &
Kiousis, 2011). A powerful case can be made that public relations strategies and tactics were first
established by political actors, in political contexts, and used for political purposes (Cutlip, 1995;
Lamme & Russell, 2009), but the majority of strategic communication theory and research targets
business, health, and nonprofit settings, and many textbooks treat strategic political communication
and public relations only in passing.

One of the major goals of political public relations efforts is to determine and communicate the
salience of political priorities in news coverage, public opinion, and policymaking in order to achieve
strategic goals and objectives (Strömbäck & Kiousis, 2011). Given their emphasis on salience
formation, transfer, and exchange, agenda-building and agenda-setting theories offer germane
conceptual frameworks for better understanding the use of strategic political public relations
activities in elections and governance (Berger, Hertog, & Park, 2002; Johnson, 2014; Kiousis,
Bantimaroudis, & Ban, 1999; Kiousis, Laskin, & Kim, 2011; Kiousis, Mitrook, Wu, & Seltzer, 2006;
Ragas & Tran, 2013).

From a strategic communication standpoint, a robust body of research has probed the influence
of information subsidies—source-controlled public relations messages—in impacting the agenda-
building process, yet a major limitation with such research is the tendency to focus on just one type
of information subsidy—often news releases or speeches—within a single analysis. When tested

empirically, though, research suggests this tendency may be problematic because the pattern of
associations found among such messages is not as consistent as might be conceptually expected (e.g.,
Kiousis & Strömbäck, 2010). Consequently, the present analysis examines a wide range of informa-
tion subsidies to address their comparative agenda-building effectiveness. Further, most extant work
has been limited to elections and the role of these messages in shaping media coverage. In political
public relations, a central strategic outcome is policymaking. As such, the current study will include
indicators of policymaking activity during nonelection settings to move the analysis beyond outputs
to outcomes (Manning & Rockland, 2011; Stacks, 2010; Watson, 2012).

In addition to the explicated connections among the salience of objects (e.g., issues) and attributes
(e.g., the framing and valence of the issues), contemporary developments in agenda-setting theory
suggest an extension of the model to examining networks of associations among agenda elements
(Guo, 2012, 2013; Kiousis et al., in press; Schultz, Kleinnijenhuis, Oegema, Utz, & van Atteveldt,
2012). That is, the co-occurrence of elements (objects and attributes) on agendas can impact the
process of salience formation and transfer across several stakeholder groups (Carroll, 2005a, 2005b).
The purpose of this study is to fill the aforementioned gaps in scholarship through examining the
agenda-building process at three levels based on multiple political public relations message types,
media coverage, and policymaking activity during the first six months of U.S. president Barack
Obama’s second term.

Literature review

First-level agenda building

In its classic conceptualization, agenda setting examined the transfer of issue salience from the media
to the public (McCombs & Shaw, 1972). Support for that basic theoretical relationship continues to be
found in a number of studies (see Johnson, 2014) for recent reviews of the accumulated evidence).
Although issues were the original focus of research, scholars have noted that first-level agenda setting is
about the transfer of object salience and can be applied to several types of objects, including candidates,
nations, products, organizations, and stakeholders (McCombs, 2014). The use of “object” here is
similar to the attitude object concept in psychology.

Agenda-building theory considers the process of salience formation, transfer and exchange
to involve reciprocal and shared influence among a variety of
stakeholder groups and
constituencies (Hughes & Dann, 2009). These groups include journalists, bloggers and other online
opinion leaders, voters, politicians, corporations, nonprofit organizations,
interest groups, and
activists. Even though an agenda-building perspective suggests a broader array of voices to monitor
in the salience formation and transfer process, most agenda-building research has considered the
relationship between news sources and the news media in the development of news content. Under
this more classic conceptualization, “agenda building explores the sources that make up news
content and influence the mass media agenda” (Tedesco, 2011, p. 78). Empirical support for first-
level agenda building within the news has been gleaned in numerous investigations (e.g., Kim, Xiang,
& Kiousis, 2011; Kiousis & Strömbäck, 2010; Kiousis & Wu, 2008; Ragas, 2013b; Ragas, Kim, &
Kiousis, 2011; Roberts, 1997; Roberts & McCombs, 1994; Sweetser & Brown, 2008).

The leading strategy for activating news attention in agenda building is through information
subsidies. According to Gandy (1982), information subsidies can be defined as “efforts to reduce the
prices faced by others for certain information in order to increase its consumption” (p. 8). Lariscy,
Avery, and Sohn (2010) employ Gandy’s conceptualization and define information subsidies as
“controlled information provided to a recipient at minimal cost and effort on his or her behalf” (p.
114). Finally, Lieber and Golan (2011) succinctly define such messages as “the currency of the trade
within the marketplace of information” (p. 60).

Among the sources of information subsidies, presidential communications have been found to
wield substantial influence on news attention (e.g., Foster et al., 2012; Parmalee, 2014). White House

communication activities have increasingly been identified as paramount to the successful manage-
ment of the executive branch of government (Eshbaugh-Soha, 2006; Iyengar & McGrady, 2007;
Kernell, 2007; Kumar, 2007; Mayer, 2004). Journalistic norms and routines dictate a heavy reliance
on “official sources,” and there is no figure larger in U.S. politics steering such processes than the
president. Nonetheless, although some studies suggest influence (Cohen, 2005; Hill, 1998; Lawrence,
2002), others display or imply limited impact (Edwards, 2004; Eshbaugh-Soha & Peake, 2005). One
reason for this discrepancy is that studies typically have focused on only one form of presidential
communication, most often the State of the Union address. Few investigations have explored in this
context the comparative role of different types of information subsidies beyond news releases. Thus,
one aim of this inquiry is to explore the comparative role of different presidential information
subsidies in the dynamics of agenda building and policymaking.

Research indicates that the most widely studied political information subsidies are news releases
and speeches. News releases have been shown to play a meaningful role in shaping news coverage
with the salience of objects in releases contributing to the salience of objects on the media agenda
(Heim, 2013; Hopmann, Elmelund-Praestekaer, Albaek, Vliegenthart, & De Vreese, 2010; Kiousis
et al., 2011; Sweetser & Brown, 2008; Turk, 1986). Research suggests that up to 80% of news content
is generated from information subsidies, such as news releases (e.g., Sweetser & Brown, 2008).

Similarly, prior empirical work has found that presidential speeches may shape the content of
news coverage to varying degrees (Hopmann et al., 2010; Kiousis et al., 2011; Turk, 1986). More
specifically, a review by McCombs (2014) of agenda-building research into the high-profile,
annual U.S. presidential State of the Union Address finds that the priorities of the president and
the national news media are often linked, with this address at times impacting subsequent media
coverage, while at other times, the address seems to respond to prior coverage. The approval
rating of the president, a measure of political capital, may play a role, as research indicates that
presidents with higher ratings generally see their information subsidies, such as speeches, have a
greater influence on the issues on the media agenda (Fahmy, Wanta, Johnson, & Zhang, 2011;
McCombs, 2014; Peake & Eshbaugh-Soha, 2008).

Scholars have also examined the role of other types of information subsidies in the agenda-
building process. For example, considerable effort has been spent examining the impact of
political advertising (e.g., Ghorpade, 1986; Lopez-Escobar, Llamas, McCombs, & Lennon, 1998;
Ragas & Kiousis, 2010; Roberts, 1997). In particular, Roberts and McCombs (1994) scrutinized
the influence of political ads on media content during the 1990 Texas gubernatorial race. Their
findings revealed that advertising shaped the salience of issues for both television news coverage
and newspapers. Boyle (2001) found similar relationships between advertising and television
news during the 1996 presidential election.

Other types of information subsidies that have been investigated include debates, news confer-
ences, and issue platform statements (e.g., Kiousis & Shields, 2008; Kiousis & Strömbäck, 2010;
Peake & Eshbaugh-Soha, 2008). Despite this, missing from research are studies that examine multiple
information subsidies and object types within the same analysis (Miller, 2010). One exception is
Kiousis, Kim, McDevitt, and Ostrowski’s (2009) inquiry examining the relative agenda-building
influence of campaign news releases and advertisements on news coverage during the 2006 election
cycle. Their findings produced connections regarding the salience of issues and their attributes
(Kiousis et al., 2009). It is noteworthy that stronger associations were found between news releases
and media content for issue salience, but stronger linkages between ads and media content for
attribute salience, suggesting differences across levels of agenda building.

A major assumption implicit in most agenda-building research is that relationships across
different types of information subsidies are similar, yet when tested empirically this has not always
been the case. Illustrating this assumption, Kiousis and Strömbäck (2010) found that the relationship
between presidential news conferences and job approval ratings can be different from the relation-
ship between presidential speeches and job approval ratings. Thus, comparisons between different
types of information subsidies are essential for theory development.

S. KIOUSIS ET AL.

Based on the logic of first-level agenda building, the following hypotheses are offered:

H1: The salience of issues in public relations messages positively correlates to the salience of
issues in news media content.
H2: The salience of issues in public relations messages positively correlates to the salience of
issues in policymaking activity.

Agenda building and digital communications

In addition to looking at a more diverse range of information subsidies, scholars have also stressed
the need to better understand the role of digital communication tools, such as Twitter and Facebook
(Lariscy, Avery, Sweetser, & Howes, 2009; Sweetser & Lariscy, 2008; Waters, Tindall, & Morton,
2010). The use of these new communication tools for agenda-building and agenda-setting purposes
has risen dramatically in recent election cycles (Avery & Graham, 2013; Parmalee, 2014), meriting
greater scrutiny. Unlike some traditional public relations activities, these digital tools have the
potential to promote dialogue and collaboration, thereby leading to enhanced relationships between
organizations and their constituencies (Avery & Graham, 2013; Reber & Kim, 2006). Nonetheless,
research has produced mixed evidence regarding their influence on journalists (e.g., Lariscy et al.,
2009; Parmalee, 2014).

One investigation compared the role of political ads and candidate blogs on media coverage
during the 2004 presidential election (Sweetser, Golan, & Wanta, 2008). The findings revealed strong
connections between both information subsidy types and media coverage, although the direction of
influence seemed to flow from the news media to the campaigns. A related analysis during the 2000
presidential election also found agenda-building linkages between candidate websites and news
content regarding issue salience (Ku, Kaid, & Pfau, 2003). Meraz (2009) observed reciprocal
influence between political blogs and mainstream news media content. Finally, Sayre, Bode, Shah,
Wilcox, and Shah (2010) reported mutual influence among social media content (YouTube), state
news media coverage, and Google News search traffic regarding a California proposition to ban
same-sex marriage in 2008 and 2009.

Given the need to examine multiple types of information subsidies through traditional and digital

channels, the following research questions are offered:

RQ1: How do the relationships between public relations messages and news coverage of object
and attribute salience vary by message type?
RQ2: How do the relationships between public relations messages and policymaking activity
regarding object and attribute salience vary by message type?

Second-level agenda building

Beyond object salience, scholars have also examined attribute salience as a component of the agenda-
setting and agenda-building processes. These inquiries demonstrate that news media (or strategic
communication and public relations efforts) highlight certain aspects of objects while simultaneously
ignoring others to help stakeholders develop an understanding about objects (e.g., Fahmy et al.,
2011; Schultz et al., 2012). Linked to framing research, the second-level agenda-setting (and agenda-
building, by extension) literature suggests that media (and strategic communication and public
relations activities) play a role in shaping public opinion by telling stakeholders “how to think
about” objects and affect comprehension (e.g., Kiousis et al., 2006; Wang & Shoemaker, 2011).

The two major types of attributes identified in the literature are substantive and affective.
Substantive attributes refer to the cognitive dimension of attribute salience based on reasoning.
For example, Entman (1993) defined framing as a process of promoting certain aspects of issues

5

more than other aspects in messages. McCombs (2014) also explained that communication messages
help people cognitively structure perceptions about objects—i.e., how to understand them. Issue
frames, corporate reputation attributes, and candidate image attributes are all examples of the
substantive attribute dimension used in prior agenda-building (and agenda-setting) studies (e.g.,
Kiousis et al., 2006; McCombs & Shaw, 1972).

In a gubernatorial election context, Kiousis et al. (2006) found connections between the portrayal
of candidate attributes in candidate news releases and state media coverage. At the national level,
Heim (2013) discovered similar evidence for Hillary Clinton’s public relations efforts on news media
content during the 2008 Iowa Democratic Caucuses but not for John Edwards and Barack Obama.
Wirth et al. (2010) found evidence of second-level agenda building and agenda setting during a 2006
referendum campaign in Switzerland. A unique feature of that investigation is that it was one of the
few to explore strategic organizational outcomes as a result of agenda-building activities. The current
study examines a different dimension of outcomes by looking at actual policymaking activity rather
than public opinion, but the emphasis on evaluation is parallel.

Affective attributes converge on the valence dimension of salience that is based on emotion. The
tone of messages is often used to operationalize affective attributes. Kim and McCombs (2007)
explained that the positive or negative portrayal of candidates in news shapes how individuals
perceive them. In the context of presidential elections, Kim et al. (2011) found supportive evidence
of affective attribute associations between candidate information subsidies and global media cover-
age of the 2008 presidential election. Although contemporary research also suggests that arousal is an
important dimension of affective attributes in second-level agenda setting and agenda building
(Coleman & Wu, 2010; Kim & Kiousis, 2012; Kim, 2012), the present study is concerned with the
tone regarding portrayals of issues. Scholars have found that the evaluative tone of media coverage
can directly affect how publics perceive an object (e.g., Kiousis et al., 1999; Schoenbach & Semetko,
1992; Sheafer, 2007).

Based on the theorizing behind second-level agenda building, the following hypotheses are

generated:

H3: The salience of substantive issue attributes in public relations messages positively corre-
lates to the salience of issue attributes in news media content.
H4: The tone of issue portrayals in public relations messages positively correlates to the tone of
issue portrayals in news media content.
H5: The salience of substantive issue attributes in public relations messages positively corre-
lates to the salience of issue attributes in policymaking activity.
H6: The tone of issue portrayals in public relations messages positively correlates to the tone of
issue portrayals in policymaking activity.

Third-level agenda building

Given the established role of object and attribute salience, current theoretical and empirical
work in agenda setting has explicated that the connections among elements on different agendas
—dubbed third-level or network agenda setting (NAS)—can impact the salience formation and
transfer process (e.g., Guo, 2012, 2013; Schultz et al., 2012). The theoretical origins can be traced
to the work of Carroll (2005a, 2005b) and network theory, though empirical testing of the model
came later. As summarized by Guo, Vu, and McCombs (2012):

. . .news media can actually bundle different objects and attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in
the public’s mind simultaneously. Drawing from Lang’s (2000) theoretical framework, the [network agenda
setting] NAS model hypothesizes that the more likely the news media mention two elements in tandem, the
greater chance that the audience will perceive these two elements as interconnected (p. 55).

S. KIOUSIS ET AL.

Previous studies on first- and second-level agenda setting/agenda building have explored the rank-
order relationships between two agendas (i.e., media and public) (i.e., McCombs & Shaw, 1972). In
these rank-order analyses, however, the relationships among elements are usually excluded. To fill in
the gap, we applied the Network Agenda Setting model (Guo, 2012) that integrates the concept of
social networks into agenda-setting and agenda-building theoretical frameworks.

Hence, the co-occurrence of certain attributes and/or objects with one another leads to a greater
likelihood that they will be perceived as salient together. This could range from a few elements on an
agenda to the entire pattern of connections among elements. In strategic political communication
and political public relations, this can have major ramifications for how politicians and issues are
depicted and perceived in public affairs discourse. In turn, this can greatly influence strategic
outcomes in terms of campaigning and governing.

For instance, during election campaigns, political candidates hope to associate favorable attributes
with their own images and unfavorable attributes with their opponents. The success of candidates in
making these associations salient to voters can mean the difference between winning and losing
elections. Within the context of policymaking, when certain issue attributes are linked with an issue,
different strategic outcomes may result. As a case in point, if the George W. Bush administration in
2004 had been unable to link weapons of mass destruction to the Iraqi regime—thereby failing to
make these elements salient in relation to one another—it is possible that a different policy strategy
may have been engendered. By extension then, this study applies the theorizing of the network
agenda setting (NAS) model to agenda building. Specifically, this inquiry explores such associations
within the context of the first six months of the Obama administration’s second term as a contrast to
most analyses focused on election settings.

Strategic political communication outcomes

Although understanding the relationship between information subsidies and news coverage is impor-
tant, scholars have underscored the need to go beyond message outputs and focus on strategic
outcomes—that is, tangible attitudes, behaviors, and actions—to assess the effectiveness of strategic
communication in achieving desired organizational goals (e.g., Hallahan, Holtzhausen, van Ruler,
Vercic, & Sriramesh, 2007; Holtzhausen & Zerfass, 2014). In a political communication context, two
central outcomes for determining success are public opinion and actual policymaking activities. One
major challenge with monitoring public opinion is in developing an analytical strategy for ascertaining
how changes in the salience of objects and attributes in information subsidies and media coverage are
linked to shifts in public support for particular policies. Appropriate public opinion data are not always
available. On the other hand, official records of policymaking activity are often available and easier to
track, thereby providing for more straightforward comparisons. As such, policymaking activity will be
the core outcome compared with strategic political communication efforts and news in this study, but
we also suggest future research examine public opinion as well when appropriate data are available.

Based on the logic of network agenda building, the following hypotheses are given:

H7: The salience of network associations among issues in public relations messages positively
correlates to the salience of network associations among issues in news media content.
H8: The salience of network associations among issues in public relations messages positively
correlates to the salience of network associations among issues in policymaking activity.
H9: The salience of network associations among substantive issue attributes in public relations
messages positively correlates to the salience of issue attributes in news media content.
H10: The salience of network associations among substantive issue attributes in public rela-
tions messages positively correlates to the salience of issue attributes in policymaking activity.

Method

A content analysis was conducted to explore all three levels of agenda building. The study time frame
was six months (from January 1 to June 31, 2013). This nonelection time frame, representing the
start of the Obama administration’s second term, fits with the study’s focus on strategic political
communication during governing and policymaking, rather than during campaigning. Prior research
shows that agenda building and agenda setting are cumulative processes that often take time to play
out (i.e., months rather than days or weeks), particularly outcomes such as policymaking (Son &
Weaver, 2006; Tan & Weaver, 2009). A total of 692 presidential public relations materials (5 weekly
YouTube addresses, 50 speeches and remarks, 20 press briefings, 119 statements and releases, 110
blog posts, and 388 tweets), 623 news stories (109 USA Today, 441 The New York Times, 73 Los
Angeles Times), and 194 policymaking calendars (1 House Calendar of Business, 78 Senate Calendars
of Business, 115 Daily Congressional Record/Daily Digest) were collected.

Sampling procedure

The primary source of presidential public relations messages was the official White House website
(www.whitehouse.gov). Speeches and remarks, press briefings, and statements and releases were
collected from the site. Social media content was collected from the White House’s official blog,
Twitter, and YouTube channels. Due to the large volume of data, these messages were systematically
sampled (20% of public relations messages).

USA Today, The New York Times, and The Los Angeles Times, the three national media outlets
with the largest combined print and digital circulations at the time of the study (Alliance for Audited
Media, 2013), were selected to represent the traditional media agenda. Archived articles during the
time frame were retrieved from LexisNexis using the search keyword “Obama” for the headline and
lead of stories because the inverted pyramid style of journalism places the most important informa-
tion at the top of stories (Ragas & Tran, 2013). Due to the large volume of data, news stories were
systematically sampled (20% of news stories).

Consistent with prior research (Kiousis, Park, Kim, & Go, 2013; Kiousis et al., 2011), policy-
making activity was obtained by monitoring the House Calendar of Business (general order), the
Senate Calendar of Business (general order), and the Daily Congressional Record (Daily Digest). A
total of 194 calendars of policymaking activity were coded.

Object salience measurement
Issues
The following 12 issue categories were developed using the official list of issue priorities on the
White House website: community issues, defense and homeland security, economy, education,
energy and environment, ethics, foreign policy, health care, immigration, taxes, technology, and
other. Each issue category was coded as 1) present or 0) absent.

Attribute salience measurement
Issue frames
The following seven categories were used to code the issue frames: conflict, cooperation (harmony),
problem/issue definition, attribution of responsibility, human interest, economic consequences, and
morality (e.g., Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 2006; Supadhiloke, 2012). These categories assess whether a
message is framing an issue in terms of conflict; the cooperation between groups; the deliberate
description of an issue; an attribution of responsibility for an issue; the placement of a “human face”
on an issue; the economic consequences of an issue; or the moral and religious aspects of an issue.
For example, a morality issue frame is reflected in the following Twitter message: President Obama

S. KIOUSIS ET AL.

on #EqualPay for equal work: “It’s the idea that all of us are created equal.” Additionally, an example
of a human interest issue frame includes the following Twitter post: “Worth a watch and a RT:
White House staffers share their immigration stories.” Then, each issue frame was coded as 1)
present or 0) absent.

Affective attribute measurement

Affective attributes were measured with regard to the overall tone displayed specifically towards each
issue mentioned in the analyzed messages (Kiousis et al., 2013). The tone was coded as 1) negative,
2) neutral/mixed, and 3) positive when it was present.

Intercoder reliability

Intercoder reliability was measured by randomly selecting a subsample (10%) of each message type and
double coding. Holsti’s score (Holsti, 1969) and Scott’s Pi (Scott, 1955) were used to assess reliability,
the latter of which corrects for chance agreement. The issue categories, issue frame categories, and
issue tone scores were reported for Holsti and Scott’s Pi. The average Holsti’s scores were reported as
.95, .94, and .90 (issue, issue frame, and issue tone), respectively; and the average Scott’s Pi scores were
reported as .84, .81, and .75, respectively.

Data analysis strategy
This study used Spearman’s rho correlations (e.g., McCombs & Shaw, 1972) to assess the first- and
second-level agenda-building hypotheses regarding the transfer of issue salience, substantive issue
attribute salience, and affective issue attribute salience among the various agendas. To test third-level
hypotheses, UCINET 6.0 (Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 1999) was used to generate quadratic
assignment procedure (QAP) correlations, which measured the network agenda associations
between the various agendas (e.g., Guo, 2012, 2013). In particular, to test network correlations,
matrix datasets were prepared for issues (12 rows × 12 columns) and frames (7 rows × 7 columns) for
each information source (i.e., press releases, blogs, or Twitter) and the media coverage. Then,
matrices filled with frequency numbers were analyzed to test whether the element-association
patterns are correlated between matrices.

Results

First-level agenda-building findings

H1 predicts that the salience of issues in presidential information subsidies will positively correlate
with the salience of issues in news content. Table 1 reports the data. The hypothesis is supported in
two out of six possible comparisons, and the median correlation value is .48.

H2 expects that the salience of issues in presidential information subsidies will positively correlate
with the salience of issues in policymaking activity. This hypothesis is supported in four out of six
possible comparisons, and the median correlation value is .58. Thus, there is modest evidence
suggesting presidential public relations efforts are linked with actual policymaking activity.

Second-level agenda-building findings

Moving to second-level findings, H3 and H4 expect that the salience of issue frames and tone
in presidential public relations messages will positively correlate to news media content. Tables
2 and 3 report the findings. For issue frames, the hypothesis is supported in one out of six

Third-level agenda-building findings

At the third level of agenda building, H7 expects that the salience of network associations among
issues in presidential information subsidies will positively correlate with the pattern of network
associations among issues in news media content. H8 predicts similar relationships between pre-

policymaking, the data support H8 in three out of six possible comparisons, and the median
correlation value is .36. In sum, modest evidence suggests that the salience of the network of
associations for issues in presidential communications correlates with news content and policy-
making activity.

Shifting to attribute salience, H9 and H10 predict that the network of associations among
substantive issue attributes in presidential information subsidies positively correlates with the net-
work of associations among these elements in news media content and policymaking activity.

Collective findings

Beyond examining associations across all three levels of agenda building, RQ1 and RQ2 explore the
differences in correlations among the various information subsidies and news coverage, and information
subsidies and policymaking activities, respectively, regarding object and attribute salience. Tables 6 and 7

activities, respectively. Considering the number of significant associations to total possible associations,
we found that news releases (4 out of 5), blogs (3 out of 5), speeches (3 out of 5), and press briefings (3 out
of 5) are the top four most frequently associated information subsidies with media coverage. For
policymaking, news releases (3 out of 5), blogs (3 out of 5) and speeches (2 out of 5) are the three
most consistently linked subsidy types.

Discussion

These findings indicate three levels of agenda-building linkages among presidential information
subsidies and national news content, and presidential information subsidies and policymaking
activities, during the first six months of U.S. President Barack Obama’s second term in office. Few
previous studies have simultaneously examined three levels of agenda building all within one
investigation and linked information subsidies with strategic outcomes, in this case Congressional
policymaking activities, rather than just media coverage. The results of this study underscore the
value in further explicating the emerging third level of agenda building (Kiousis et al., in press;
Shultz et al., 2012) and extending the network agenda-setting model (Carroll, 2005a, 2005b; Guo,
2012, 2013) to a political strategic communication context, as the strongest linkages were found
among network agendas.

Although the results of this study indicate that the president’s priorities, as articulated in his
presidential information subsidies, aligned to a decent degree with national media coverage and
policymaking activities, the somewhat muted impact of his efforts may be due to his reduced
popularity (Iyengar & McGrady, 2007). President Obama started his second term in office with a
hard-fought election win and a sharply divided country. Gallup (2013) data shows that Obama
entered his second term in January 2013 with 53% public approval. That number had declined to
44% six months later. For further comparison, Obama entered office in late January 2009 with
a commanding 67% approval rating (Gallup, 2013). Declining public opinion towards the president
likely diminished his political capital and may have reduced his agenda-building influence (Fahmy
et al., 2011; Peake & Eshbaugh-Soha, 2008). Of course, the reduced agenda-building correlations
could also be due to possible sampling, measurement, or research design issues so this represents one
possible interpretation.

Theoretical implications

Several important theoretical implications emerged from this study. First, this analysis is unique in
that it contributes to theory development by focusing on the application of agenda-building theory
to an understudied area—political governing, rather than political campaigns (Strömbäck & Kiousis,
2011). Strategic political communication seeks to establish and communicate the salience of political
priorities in news coverage, public opinion, and policymaking activities so as to achieve goals.
Therefore, agenda-building theory provides a natural framework for exploring such relationships
in an increasingly complex communication and media environment. The results of this study suggest
that official and authoritative sources like the president still play a fundamental role in the political
agenda-building process, but the raw power of this role in salience formation, transfer, and exchange
among other stakeholder groups could be moderating (Meraz, 2009; Ragas & Tran, 2013; Shehata &
Strömbäck, 2013).

Second, this study clearly demonstrates that the agenda-building role and impact of different
political information subsidies are not uniform and should not be treated as such (Kiousis et al.,
2009). For example, at least from an agenda-building and noncampaign perspective, presidential
news releases seemed to play an instrumental role. The effectiveness of specific subsidies also
seems to vary across the levels of agenda building. For example, when it comes to both media
coverage and policymaking, news releases seem ideal for conveying issue salience (first-level) and
the substantive and affective framing of such issues (second-level). For issue tone, the priorities

S. KIOUSIS ET AL.

expressed on the presidential blog and press briefings also appear consequential. At the third-
level, in addition to news releases, blogs and press briefings, presidential speeches emerged as an
effective tool for linking issues and making them salient together. Such insights and nuances
would not have been possible if this study had been restricted to the analysis of only one level of
agenda-building or one information subsidy type (Kiousis et al., 2013).

Third, this study complements and extends recent efforts to further agenda-building research to
the study of strategic political outcomes (e.g., policymaking) rather than solely outputs such as media
coverage (Kim & Kiousis, 2012; Kiousis et al., 2011, 2013, in press). Although media management is
a meaningful step in managing public opinion and gauging success, in a political setting, determin-
ing the contribution a candidate or elected official’s strategic communication efforts make on
policymaking is paramount (Wirth et al., 2010). Even in the face of Obama’s diminished political
capital, this study’s results show that some presidential public relations efforts were associated with a
very consequential and strategic outcome—Congressional policymaking. More specifically, when
looking at the linkages among presidential information subsidies and policymaking across three
levels, two subsidy types stand out: news releases and blogs. A recent study by Kiousis and colleagues
(2013) of the correlations among political subsidies, media coverage, and policymaking regarding the
healthcare reform debate also found that traditional communication vehicles such as news releases
were effective.

Finally, this may be the first study to extend and test the theorizing of the network agenda setting
(NAS) model (Guo, 2012, 2013) to the agenda-building role of strategic communication efforts on
policymaking. In practice, politicians and their political communication advisors not only attempt to
bundle and make salient together pairs of issues or frames as part of a media relations strategy, but for
this network agenda to impact policymaking discourse as well. Evidence in this study of significant
linkages between the issue agenda network the president conveyed in his speeches, blog posts, and news
releases with the issue agenda network articulated in Congressional policymaking activities, speaks to a
subtle, more complex agenda-building impact than had previously been understood, prior to the
explication of the third-level.

Practical implications

The White House has readily spoken of the challenges in attempting to manage the national
conversations surrounding its political priorities in an increasingly complex communication envir-
onment (Kumar, 2007; Scherer, 2010). To better manage what Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to Obama
on strategy and communication, has called the “constant swirl” of the news cyclone, the White
House has broadened its political public relations efforts into a wider range of digital communication
channels (Scherer, 2010). The results of this study provide evidence that these digital channels have
varying levels of effectiveness in building the news and policymaking agendas. In particular, the
White House blog was the most effective digital communication agenda-building tool at the start of
Obama’s second term. There is little to no evidence that the White House’s Twitter account played a
role in shaping coverage or policymaking. This may be due to the very short format of Twitter (i.e.,
140 characters), which is adept at conveying breaking news, but has limited message carrying
capacity.

These results indicate that cognitive factors are central to political information processing for
journalists and policymakers. News releases, speeches, and blogs usually have more room for
information about policies or issues than social network sites such as Twitter. The results may differ
if public opinion data were included in the study. Compared to media or political professionals, the
general public’s information processing could be more influenced by their mood or affect. Hence, to
explore the agenda-building role of social media content (Twitter), public opinion data would be a
useful source in addition to the media and policymaking agendas.

The effectiveness of the White House blog at agenda building is particularly noteworthy when
juxtaposed against another recent agenda-building study (Kiousis et al., in press), which looked at

13

the role of a wide range of political information subsidies during the preconvention phase of the
2012 U.S. presidential primaries. This aforementioned study also found that the candidate blogs were
the most effective digital agenda-building tool. Although blogs receive less buzz than newer social
media channels like Twitter, these findings suggest that blogs should remain a key component of
communication strategy. Political blogs are often viewed as a key information source for journalists,
but may play just as an important role for policymakers and their staffs. The longer-format nature of
blogs allow for a more substantive presentation of issues by candidates and politicians than these
other digital tools.

At the same time, the findings of the current study also speak to the continued value of using
traditional, analog communication channels in building political agendas (Kiousis & Strömbäck,
2010). News releases were the most effective all-around information subsidy for both media manage-
ment and policymaking. Although not as effective as news releases, presidential speeches also seemed
to be a meaningful tool for both media management and policymaking. Taking a step back and
looking at this study’s findings from a high level, even in an era of digital communication (Avery &
Graham, 2013; Parmalee, 2014), strategic communicators would seem well served to use a mix of
digital and analog information subsidies to achieve political goals and objectives rather than adopt an
“either or” philosophy.

Limitations and conclusions

As with any study, there are limitations that should be taken into account when reviewing these
results and the conclusions drawn from them. Internal replications strengthened the reliability of the
hypothesized relationships and results (Chaffee, 2009; Littlejohn & Foss, 2011), but this study was
limited by its cross-sectional and correlation-based design. Such a design cannot get at causation
among the presidential and media agendas. Future research should focus more on the time ordering
and third-level variables in these relationships (Bryant, Thompson, & Finklea, 2013). For example,
longitudinal designs would allow researchers to examine if there is mutual influence—agenda-
sharing (Ragas, 2013a)—between the president and policymakers when it comes to setting policy
agendas. As with any content analysis, this study is also limited by decisions made about the
sampling procedure and coding protocol, which could introduce some level of sampling and
measurement error into the results. As a research method, a content analysis is also limited by the
availability of archived material to analyze. For example, there were far less policymaking material
collected and used in the study than information subsidies and news articles. As such, only 20% of
the available information subsidies and news articles were included in the study to achieve a more
consistent sample size compared to policymaking material available. Also, a high level of reliability
was achieved in coding, yet there may be questions about validity. As such, other research methods
should be used in the future to support or refute these findings.

Further, the role of strategic political communication influence in governing should be extended
from a national level down to statewide and municipal office levels (Avery & Graham, 2013), as well
as in international settings. In addition, this study was conducted at the aggregate level of agendas
and did not probe the specific influence of particular issues, frames, or tones. Future scholarship
should consider such differences now that these baseline relationships have been established. Such
research will help further establish the generalizability of these propositions and detect nuances
based on places, people, and times. Finally, more types of political information subsidies and news
content, such as broadcast coverage, should be probed and different markers of policymaking tested.

Abstract
Antihydrogen is at the forefront of antimatter research at the CERN Antiproton Decelerator.
Experiments aiming to test the fundamental CPT symmetry and antigravity effects require the efﬁcient
detection of antihydrogen annihilation events, which is performed using highly granular tracking
detectors installed around an antimatter trap. Improving the efﬁciency of the antihydrogen
annihilation detection plays a central role in the ﬁnal sensitivity of the experiments. We propose deep
learning as a novel technique to analyze antihydrogen annihilation data, and compare its performance
with a traditional track and vertex reconstruction method. We report that the deep learning approach
yields signiﬁcant improvement, tripling event coverage while simultaneously improving performance
in terms of AUC by 5%.

1. Introduction

In recent years numerous experiments have successfully trapped, or formed a beam of, antihydrogen atoms.
These experiments aim to test CPT symmetry by comparing the properties of the antihydrogen atom to those of
the hydrogen atom [1–4], or test the effects of gravity on antimatter [5–7]. Antihydrogen is produced either by
injecting antiproton and positron plasmas into cryogenic electro-magnetic traps where three-body

Previous experiments have detected trapped antimatter annihilation events using algorithms speciﬁcally
developed for tracking and vertex-ﬁnding [9–15], predominantly adopted from high-energy physics (HEP).
However, antimatter trap experiments are not designed for high-resolution and high-efﬁciency tracking
performance; the necessary layers of vacuum chamber walls, multi-ring electrodes, and thermal isolation limits
the resolution of the detector and the effectiveness of these algorithms. Therefore, the vertex-reconstruction
approach may not be optimal for detecting antihydrogen event signals in this setting.

We present a machine learning approach for analyzing data from antimatter trap experiments that does not
require explicit vertex reconstruction. Speciﬁcally, we propose deep learning with artiﬁcial neural networks as a
strategy to identify antihydrogen annihilation signatures from low-level detector data alone. This approach has
the advantage of being able to exploit subtle and previously-unrecognized characteristics in the data, as
demonstrated in Higgs-search and Higgs-decay studies from HEP [16–18]. We train our system using Monte
Carlo simulated data to distinguish between antihydrogen-like signal and antiproton background annihilation
events, and compare the performance to a traditional track and vertex reconstruction method.

The speciﬁc use case presented in this paper is the ASACUSA antihydrogen experiment [4], whose aim is to
directly compare the ground-state hyperﬁne transition frequency of hydrogen with that of antihydrogen—a test

of the CPT-invariance principle. Measurements of the antihydrogen hyperﬁne transition frequency are
performed by measuring the rate of antihydrogen atom production in a Penning–Malmberg trap while
controlling the antiproton injection conditions, the overlap time while mixing antimatter plasmas, and other
key parameters which allow us to constrain the three-body recombination yield and the level population
evolution time of the formed antiatoms [19]. Thus, the sensitivity of the experiment depends directly on the
efﬁcient detection of antihydrogen annihilations.

Other antihydrogen experiments face similar challenges. Although the background processes or event
topology might be different, classifying annihilations in a cryogenic environment with signiﬁcant material
budget is a common problem. Therefore, advances in single annihilation event classiﬁcation in ASACUSA could
potentially lead to performance improvements in other experiments.

2. Monte Carlo simulation and annihilation event reconstruction

The ASACUSA experiment traps charged particles (antiprotons and positrons) on the central axis using electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. When a neutral antihydrogen atom is produced (predominately via three-body recombination
of antiprotons and positrons), it may escape these trapping ﬁelds and annihilate on the inner wall of the trap,
emitting charged pions that can be detected. However, continuous annihilation of trapped antiprotons on
residual gas atoms produces background annihilation events that emit the same pions. The latter tend to be
emitted from the central axis, rather than the inner wall, so we can distinguish between antihydrogen and
antiproton events if the position of the annihilation can be inferred from the detector data.

The pions are detected by the Asacusa Micromegas Tracker (AMT) [15], which consists of a full-cylinder
layer of plastic trigger scintillator bars sandwiched in between two, half-cylinder, curved micro-strip pattern
gaseous detector layers of Micromegas technology [20, 21]. In the typical vertex-ﬁnding approach, each trigger
event is processed with a track and vertex reconstruction algorithm, proceeding as follows. First, the single
detector channels are searched for entries above threshold, and neighboring channels are iteratively clustered to
form hits. The detected hits are used to form and ﬁt tracks, using a Kalman-ﬁltering algorithm [22]. After ﬁtting
all hit pair combinations in an event, the track candidates are ﬁltered by their compatibility with the known
antiproton cloud position. The ﬁltered track candidates are then paired, and their three-dimensional point of
closest approach is assigned as the vertex position. Finally, event classiﬁcation is performed based on the radial
distance of the reconstructed vertex closest to the central axis.

In order to test the ability of this algorithm to discriminate between signal and background annihilations,

Monte Carlo simulations were performed to produce event data that reﬂect the realistic conditions in the
ASACUSA experiment. The Geant4 toolkit [23] was used to simulate the antihydrogen and antiproton
annihilation processes, the trap environment, and the AMT. The full material budget of the cryogenic vacuum
trap was used in order accurately model the effects of multiple Coulomb scattering on the emitted pions [24]
before they reached the surrounding detector. Micromegas single hit resolution was simulated with Garﬁeld++,
Magboltz, and Heed [25, 26] for the response of charged pions of p
/c momentum, and was found
to be much better (

due to Coulomb scattering when the pions reach the AMT detector. Using the detected hits, the reconstructed
vertex position resolution was estimated to be

The result of vertex-reconstruction on the simulated data is illustrated in ﬁgure 1. In the ASACUSA

experiment, tracking detector layers are only present in the upper half of the trap, which is reﬂected in the
distribution of reconstructed vertices. The shape of the distribution also reﬂects the smearing of the position by

3. Deep learning approach

We propose a deep learning approach in which an artiﬁcial neural network is trained to classify annihilations
directly from the raw detector data. This automated, end-to-end learning strategy can potentially identify
discriminative information in the raw data that is typically discarded by the vertex-reconstruction algorithm.
For example, this approach will provide predictions for events on which vertex-reconstruction fails, such as
when only a single track can be reconstructed.

Two design choices were made regarding the neural network architecture that address the geometry of the
detector. First, data from micro-strips situated along the azimuth (f) and axial (Z) dimensions are processed

along separate pathways that are then merged by concatenating the hidden representations higher in the
architecture. Second, each pathway consists of alternating 1D convolution and max-pooling layers, which repeat
the same feature detectors (via weight-sharing) and pool activity from adjacent neurons. This design accounts
for the translational invariances of the detector and reduces the total number of network parameters.

The raw detector data consists of 1430 binary values from the two detector layers and two micro-strip

orientations: 246 inner and 290 outer azimuthal strips, and 447 inner and 447 outer axial strips. The inner and
outer detector layers are treated as two associated ‘channels’, where the outer azimuthal layer is downsampled
with linear interpolation to match the dimensionality of the inner layer. A diagram of the network architecture is
shown in ﬁgure 2.

4. Results

One million annihilation events of each type were simulated and randomly divided into training (60%),
validation (20%), and test subsets (20%). Because the detector only covers half of the trap, many pions escaped
undetected, and the vertex ﬁnding (VF) algorithm failed on 75% of these events: 20% did not result in any
detector hits; 7% had a hit in only one detector; and 48% had hits in both detectors but a vertex could not be
reconstructed. Vertex reconstruction failed because either (1) there were not enough distinct hits to infer the
presence of at least two tracks, or (2) the point of closest approach of the reconstructed tracks was greater than
the threshold value of 1 cm. Thus, a direct performance comparison was only possible on the 25% of the test set
events for which the VF algorithm succeeded, even though the deep learning approach provides a prediction for
every event.

Due to the complexity of the non-neutral plasma physics and atomic scattering processes, there is no physics

model to our knowledge that would be able to predict the true axial distribution of the antihydrogen atoms in
realistic experimental conditions. In the future, characterization of this distribution may lead to improved
performance, but for the present analysis we train the classiﬁer in such a way that the output is invariant to

layers.

for which an annihilation vertex can be reconstructed (‘Vertex Found’, 25% of all events). Also shown are the curves for DNN
predictions on the subset of events in which both the inner and outer detector channels are hit, but no vertex could be reconstructed
(48% of all events), and on events in which only one channel is hit (7% of all events).

of 2000 units (NN), XGBoost (XGB), and a logistic regression model (equivalent to a neural network with no hidden layer). Predictions
are made on the three event subsets: events for which a vertex can be reconstructed (Vertex Found), events in which both detector
channels are hit but no vertex can be reconstructed (Two Channels), and events in which only one channel is hit (One Channel). The
discriminative capability of the logistic regression model is predominately a result of the Z-dependence shown in ﬁgure 3, where the
antihydrogen distribution has a tighter spread around Z=100.

representations from the two pathways are then concatenated and followed by two fully-connected layers of 50
and 25 rectiﬁed linear units, then a single logistic output unit with a relative entropy loss. During training, 50%
dropout was used in the top two fully-connected layers to reduce overﬁtting [29, 30]. The model weights were
initialized from a scaled normal distribution as suggested by He et al [31], then trained using the Adam optimizer
[32] (

objective did not improve within a window of three epochs. The models were implemented in KERAS [33] and
THEANO [34], and trained on a cluster of Nvidia Titan Black processors.

Performance comparisons were made by plotting the receiver operating characteristic curve and

summarizing the discrimination by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Figure 4 shows that the deep
neural network classiﬁer outperforms the VF approach by a large margin on the test events for which a vertex
could be reconstructed (0.87 versus 0.76 AUC). Remarkably, the deep neural network achieves 0.78 AUC on a
disjoint set of events for which a vertex could not be reconstructed, and 0.82 AUC on the union set containing all
events for which both detector layers were hit (not shown). This effectively triples the event coverage—to 73% of
all events—while simultaneously improving the AUC by more than 0.05. These results clearly demonstrate that
useful information contained in the raw data is being discarded by the VF algorithm, and that the deep learning
approach is able to use this information to improve discrimination.

Additional experiments evaluated the advantage of deep learning compared to ‘shallow’ machine learning

with boosted decision trees and neural networks with only a single hidden layer. These experiments were
performed on the non-augmented data, where the convolution and pooling layers provide less of an advantage
for the DNN. Figure 5 shows that XGBoost [35] and shallow neural networks both perform better than the VF
algorithm using the raw detector data (0.89 and 0.90 AUC on the same test events), but not as well as the DNN
(0.92 AUC). The shallow network had 2000 hidden rectiﬁed linear units and was trained with 70% dropout in
the hidden layer and the Adam optimizer (
= - ); the hidden layer
a
size, dropout probability, and learning rate were optimized based on validation performance. The XGBoost
classiﬁer had 100 trees with a maximum depth of 100 and minimum child weight of 10, and was trained with
h = , L2 regularization factor of 0.1, and feature sampling rate 0.5.

5. Conclusion

In summary, we report the ﬁrst application of deep learning for the identiﬁcation of antihydrogen annihilation
events using realistic Monte Carlo simulations of both antihydrogen-like signals and antiproton background
events. Moreover, we address the scenario in which classiﬁcation must be translationally-invariant in the axial
dimension to address systematic uncertainty in the experiment. The results demonstrate signiﬁcant
performance improvements compared to track and vertex reconstruction approaches in a scenario with limited
detector resolution. Vertex reconstruction necessarily discards statistical information when ﬁtting tracks, and
the approach fails completely on all but 25% of events in our experiments. With the deep learning approach, an
end-to-end neural network model extracts additional statistical information from the raw data, improving AUC
from 0.76 to 0.87 on the same event subset. It also has far better coverage, achieving 0.82 AUC on the 73% of
events in which both detector layers were hit.

While we expect more modest performance gains in detectors with better resolution, the deep learning

approach proposed here can easily be deployed to other ongoing antimatter experiments with different
instruments. Furthermore, the ability to detect complex signals in high-dimensional data without relying on
explicit track reconstruction potentially offers a new direction in the design of future detectors.

Finally, the data used in this paper, comprising two million events, are publicly available from the machine

learning in physics web portal: http://mlphysics.ics.uci.edu.

Abstract

Abstract: Random backpropagation (RBP) is a variant of the
backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks, where the
transpose of the forward matrices are replaced by ﬁxed random ma-
trices in the calculation of the weight updates. It is remarkable both
because of its eﬀectiveness, in spite of using random matrices to com-
municate error information, and because it completely removes the
taxing requirement of maintaining symmetric weights in a physical
neural system. To better understand random backpropagation, we
ﬁrst connect it to the notions of local learning and learning channels.
Through this connection, we derive several alternatives to RBP, in-
cluding skipped RBP (SRPB), adaptive RBP (ARBP), sparse RBP,
and their combinations (e.g. ASRBP) and analyze their computa-
tional complexity. We then study their behavior through simulations
using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 bechnmark datasets. These simula-
tions show that most of these variants work robustly, almost as well
as backpropagation, and that multiplication by the derivatives of the
activation functions is important. As a follow-up, we study also the
low-end of the number of bits required to communicate error infor-
mation over the learning channel. We then provide partial intuitive
explanations for some of the remarkable properties of RBP and its
variations. Finally, we prove several mathematical results, including
the convergence to ﬁxed points of linear chains of arbitrary length, the

data, the long-term existence of solutions for linear systems with a
single hidden layer and convergence in special cases, and the conver-
gence to ﬁxed points of non-linear chains, when the derivative of the
activation functions is included.

Introduction

Over the years, the question of biological plausibility of the backpropagation
algorithm, implementing stochastic gradient descent in neural networks, has
been raised several times. The question has gained further relevance due to
the numerous successes achieved by backpropagation in a variety of problems
ranging from computer vision [21, 31, 30, 14] to speech recognition [12] in
engineering, and from high energy physics [7, 26] to biology [8, 32, 1] in the
natural sciences, as well to recent results on the optimality of backpropaga-
tion [6]. There are however, several well known issues facing biological neural
networks in relation to backpropagation, these include: (1) the continuous
real-valued nature of the gradient information and its ability to change sign,
violating Dale’s Law; (2) the need for some kind of teacher’s signal to provide
targets; (3) the need for implementing all the linear operations involved in
backpropagation; (4) the need for multiplying the backpropagated signal by
the derivatives of the forward activations each time a layer is traversed; (5)
the need for precise alternation between forward and backward passes; and
(6) the complex geometry of biological neurons and the problem of transmit-
ting error signals with precision down to individual synapses. However, per-
haps the most formidable obstacle is that the standard backpropagation al-
gorithm requires propagating error signals backwards using synaptic weights
that are identical to the corresponding forward weights. Furthermore, a re-
lated problem that has not been suﬃciently recognized, is that this weight
symmetry must be maintained at all times during learning, and not just dur-
ing early neural development. It is hard to imagine mechanisms by which
biological neurons could both create and maintain such perfect symmetry.
However, recent simulations [24] surprisingly indicate that such symmetry
may not be required after all, and that in fact backpropagation works more
or less as well when random weights are used to backpropagate the errors.
Our general goal here is to investigate backpropagation with random weights
and better understand why it works.

The foundation for better understanding random backpropagation (RBP)
is provided by the concepts of local learning and deep learning channels in-
troduced in [6]. Thus we begin by introducing the notations and connecting
RBP to these concepts. In turn, this leads to the derivation of several alterna-
tives to RBP, which we study through simulations on well known benchmark
datasets before proceeding with more formal analyses.

2 Setting, Notations, and the Learning Chan-

nel

Throughout this paper, we consider layered feedforward neural networks and
supervised learning tasks. We will denote such an architecture by

A[N0, . . . , Nh, . . . , NL]

(1)

where N0 is the size of the input layer, Nh is the size of hidden layer h,
and NL is the size of the output layer. We assume that the layers are fully
ij denote the weight connecting neuron j in layer h − 1
connected and let wh
to neuron i in layer h. The output Oh
i of neuron i in layer h is computed by:

(cid:2)

Oh

i = f h

i (Sh

i ) where Sh

i =

ijOh−1
wh

j

(2)

j

The transfer functions f h
i are usually the same for most neurons, with typ-
ical exceptions for the output layer, and usually are monotonic increasing
functions. The most typical functions used in artiﬁcial neural networks are
the: identity, logistic, hyperbolic tangent, rectiﬁed linear, and softmax.

We assume that there is a training set of M examples consisting of input
and output-target pairs (I(t), T (t)), with t = 1, . . . , M . Ii(t) refers to the
i-th component of the t-th input training example, and similarly for the
target Ti(t). In addition, there is an error function E to be minimized by the
learning process. In general we will asssume standard error functions such as
the squared error in the case of regression and identity transfer functions in
the output layer, or relative entropy in the case of classiﬁcation with logistic
(single class) or softmax (multi-class) units in the output layer, although this
is not an essential point.

While we focus on supervised learning, it is worth noting that several “un-
supervised” learning algorithms for neural networks (e.g. autoencoders, neu-

3

ral autoregressive distribution estimators, generative adversarial networks)
come with output targets and thus fall into the framework used here.

2.1 Standard Backpropagation (BP)
Standard backpropagation implements gradient descent on E, and can be
applied in a stochastic fashion on-line (or in mini batches) or in batch form,
by summing or averaging over all training examples. For a single example,
omitting the t index for simplicity, the standard backpropagation learning
rule is easily obtained by applying the chain rule and given by:

Δwh

ij = −η
where η is the learning rate, Oh−1
is
the backpropagated error. Using the chain rule, it is easy to see that the
backpropagated error satisﬁes the recurrence relation:

∂E
∂wh

with the boundary condition:

i =

i

Thus in short the errors are propagated backwards in an essentially linear
fashion using the transpose of the forward matrices, hence the symmetry
of the weights, with a multiplication by the derivative of the corresponding
forward activations every time a layer is traversed.

2.2 Standard Random Backpropagation (RBP)

Standard random backpropagation operates exactly like backpropagation ex-
cept that the weights used in the backward pass are completely random and
ﬁxed. Thus the learning rule becomes:

Δwh

ij = ηRh

i Oh−1

j

(6)

where the randomly back-propagated error satisﬁes the recurrence relation:

and the weights ch+1

Thus in RBP the weights in the top layer of the architecture are updated by
gradient descent, identically to the BP case.

2.3 The Critical Equations

Within the supervised learning framework considered here, the goal is to ﬁnd
an optimal set of weights wh
ij. The equations that the weights must satisfy
at any critical point are simply:

i (t)Oh−1
Bh

j

(t) = 0

(9)

(cid:2)

=

t

∂E
∂wh
ij

Thus in general the optimal weights must depend on both the input and the
targets, as well as the other weights in the network. And learning can be
viewed as a lossy storage procedure for transferring the information contained
in the training set into the weights of the architecture.
The critical Equation 9 shows that all the necessary forward information
about the inputs and the lower weights leading up to layer h− 1 is subsumed
by the term Oh−1
(t). Thus in this framework a separate channel for commu-
nicating information about the inputs to the deep weights is not necessary.
Thus here we focus on the feedback information about the targets, contained
in the term Bh
i (t) which, in a physical neural system, must be transmitted
through a dedicated channel.

j

Note that Bh

i (t) depends on the output OL(t), the target T (t), as well as
all the weights in the layers above h in the fully connected case (otherwise
just those weight which are on a path from unit i in layer h to the output
units), and in two ways: through OL(t) and through the backpropagation
process. In addition, Bh
i (t) depends also on all the upper derivatives, i.e. the
derivatives of the activations functions for all the neurons above unit i in layer
h in the fully connected case (otherwise just those derivatives which are on a

5

path from unit i in layer h to the output units). Thus in general, in a solution
ij must depend on Oh−1
of the critical equations, the weights wh
, the outputs,
the targets, the upper weights, and the upper derivatives. Backpropagation
, T − O, the
shows that it is suﬃcient for the weights to depend on Oh−1
upper weights, and the upper derivatives.

2.4 Local Learning

Ultimately, for optimal learning, all the information required to reach a crit-
ical point of E must appear in the learning rule of the deep weights. In a
physical neural system, learning rules must also be local [6], in the sense
that they can only involve variables that are available locally in both space
and time, although for simplicity here we will focus only on locality in space.
Thus typically, in the present formalism, a local learning rule for a deep layer
must be of the form

Δwh

ij = F (Oh

i , Oh−1

j

, wh
ij)

and

ΔwL

ij = F (Ti, OL

i , OL−1

j

, wL
ij)

(10)

(11)

assuming that the targets are local variables for the top layer. Among other
things, this allows one to organize and stratify learning rules, for instance by
considering polynomial learning rules of degree one, two, and so forth.

Deep local learning is the term we use to describe the use of local learning
in all the adaptive layers of a feedforward architecture. Note that Hebbian
learning [15] is a form of local learning, and deep local learning has been
proposed for instance by Fukushima [10] to train the neocognitron architec-
ture, essentially a feed forward convolutional neural network inspired by the
earlier neurophysiological work of Hubel and Wiesel [18]. However, in deep
local learning, information about the targets is not propagated to the deep
layers and therefore in general deep local learning cannot ﬁnd solutions of
the critical equations, and thus cannot succeed at learning complex functions
[6].

6

2.5 The Deep Learning Channel

From the critical equations, any optimal neural network learning algorithm
must be capable of communicating some information about the outputs, the
targets, and the upper weights to the deep weights and, in a physical neural
system, a communication channel [28, 27] must exist to communicate this
information. This is the deep learning channel, or learning channel in short
[6], which can be studied using tools from information and complexity the-
ory. In physical systems the learning channel must correspond to a physical
channel and this leads to important considerations regarding its nature, for
instance whether it uses the forward connections in the reverse direction or
a diﬀerent set of connections. Here, we focus primarily on how information
is coded and sent over this channel.

ij(T, OL, wl

rs for l > h, f

(cid:2)

is denoted by I h

In general, the information about the outputs and the targets commu-
nicated through this channel to wh
ij(T, OL). Although
ij
backpropagation propagates this information from the top layer to the deep
layers in a staged way, this is not necessary and I h
ij(T, OL) could be sent
directly to the deep layer h somehow skipping all the layers above. This
observation leads immediately to the skipped variant of RBP described in
the next section.
It is also important to note that in principle this infor-

mation should have the form I h
(Sl
However standard backpropagation shows that it is possible to send the
same information to all the synapses impinging onto the same neuron, and
thus it is possible to learn with a simpler type of information of the form
r) for l ≥ h) targeting the postsynaptic neuron i.
I h

i (T, OL, wl
This class of algorithms or channels is what we call deep targets algorithms,
as they are equivalent to providing a target for each deep neuron. Further-
more, backpropagation shows that all the necessary information about the
outputs and the targets is contained in the term T − OL so that we only need
i (T − OL, wl
I h
r) for l > h). Standard backpropagation uses
information about the upper weights in two ways: (1)through the output OL
which appears in the error terms T − OL; and through the backpropagation
process itself. Random backpropagation crucially shows that the information
about the upper weights contained in the backpropagation process is not nec-
essary. Thus ultimately we can focus exclusively on information which has

cial cases. Obvious important questions, for which we will seek full or par-

We are going to focus on algorithms where the information required for the

deep weight updates I h
(Sl
through a linear process whereby the vector T (t) − O(t), computed in the
output layer, is processed through linear operations, i.e. additions and multi-
plications by constants (which can include multiplication by the upper deriva-
tives). Standard backpropagation is such an algorithm, but there are many
other possible ones. We are interested in the case where the matrices are
random. However, even within this restricted setting, there are several pos-
sibilities, depending for instance on: (1) whether the information is progres-
sively propagated through the layers (as in the case of BP), or broadcasted
directly to the deep layers; (2) whether multiplication by the derivatives of
the forward activations is included or not; and (3) the properties of the ma-
trices in the learning channel (e.g. sparse vs dense). This leads to several
new algorithms. Here we will use the following notations:

• BP= (standard) backpropagation.

8

• RBP= random backpropagation, where the transpose of the feedfor-

ward matrices are replaced by random matrices.

• SRBP = skipped random backpropagation, where the backpropagated
signal arriving onto layer h is given by C h(T −O) with a random matrix
C h directly connecting the output layer L to layer h, and this for each
layer h.

• ARBP = adaptive random backpropagation, where the matrices in
the learning channel are initialized randomly, and then progressively
adapted during learning using the product of the corresponding for-
ward and backward signals, so that Δcl
r, where R denotes
the randomly backpropagated error. In this case, the forward channel
becomes the learning channel for the backward weights.

rs = ηRl+1

s Ol

• ASRBP = adaptive skipped random backpropagation, which combines

adaptation with skipped random backpropagation.

• The default for each algorithm involves the multiplication at each layer
by the derivative of the forward activation functions. The variants
where this multiplication is omitted will be denoted by: “(no f’)”.

• The default for each algorithm involves dense random matrices, gen-
erated for instance by sampling from a normalized Gaussian for each
weight. But one can consider also the case of random ±1 (or (0,1))
binary matrices, or other distributions, including sparse versions of the
above.

• As we shall see, using random weights that have the same sign as
the forward weights is not essential, but can lead to improvements in
speed and stability. Thus we will use the word “congruent weights”
to describe this case. Note that with ﬁxed random matrices in the
learning channel initialized congruently, congruence can be lost during
learning when the sign of a forward weight changes.

SRBP is introduced both for information theoretic reasons– what hap-
pens if the error information is communicated directly?–and because it may
facilitate the mathematical analyses since it avoids the backpropagation pro-
cess. However, in one of the next sections, we will also show empirically that
SRBP is a viable learning algorithm, which in practice can work even better

9

than RBP. Importantly, these simulation results suggest that when learn-
ing the synaptic weight wh
ij the information about all the upper derivatives

f
Note this suggests yet another possible algorithm, skipped backropagation
(SBP). In this case, for each training example and at each epoch, the matrix
used in the feedback channel is the product of the corresponding transposed
forward matrices, ignoring multiplication by the derivative of the forward
transfer functions in all the layers above the layer under consideration. Mul-
tiplication by the derivative of the forward transfer functions is applied to
the layer under consideration. Another possibility is to have a combination
of RBP and SRBP in the learning channel, implemented by a combination of
long-ranged connections carrying SRBP signals with short-range connections
carrying a backpropagation procedure, when no long-range signals are avail-
able. This may be relevant for biology since combinations of long-ranged and
short-ranged feedback connections is common in biological neural systems.

(cid:2)

In general, in the case of linear networks, f

= 1 and therefore including
or excluding derivative terms makes no diﬀerence. Furthermore, for any
linear architecture A[N, . . . , N, . . . , N ] where all the layers have the same
size, then RBP is equivalent to SRBP. However, if the layers do not have the
same size, then the layer sizes introduce rank constraints on the information
that is backpropagated through RBP that may diﬀer from the information
propagated through SRBP. In both the linear and non-linear cases, for any
network of depth 3 (L = 3), RBP is equivalent to SRBP, since there is only
one random matrix.

Additional variations can be obtained by using dropout, or multiple sets of
random matrices, in the learning channel, for instance for averaging purposes.
Another variation in the skipped case is cascading, i.e. allowing backward
matrices in the learning channel between all pairs of layers. Note that the
notion of cascading increases the number of weights and computations, yet
it is still interesting from an exploratory and robustness point of view.

3.1 Computational Complexity Considerations

The number of computations required to send error information over the
learning channel is a fundamental quantity which, however, depends on the
computational model used and the cost associated with various operations.
Obviously, everything else being equal, the computational cost of BP and

10

RBP are basically the same since they diﬀer only by the value of the weights
being used. However more subtle diﬀerences can appear with some of the
other algorithms, such as SRBP.

To illustrate this, consider an architecture A[N0, . . . , Nh, . . . , NL], fully

connected, and let W be the total number of weights. In general, the primary
cost of BP is the multiplication of each synaptic weight by the corresponding
signal in the backward pass. Thus it is easy to see that the bulk of the
operations required for BP to compute the backpropagated signals scale like
O(W ) (in fact Θ(W )) with:

W = N0 × N1 + N1 × N2 . . . + NL−1 × NL =

L−1(cid:2)

NkNk+1

(14)

k=0

Note that whether biases are added separately or, equivalently, implemented
by adding a unit clamped to one to each layer, does not change the scaling.
Likewise, adding the costs associated with the sums computed by each neuron
and the multiplications by the derivatives of the activation functions does not
change the scaling, as long as these operations have costs that are within a
constant multiplicative factor of the cost for multiplications of signals by
synaptic weights.

As already mentioned, the scaling for RBP is obviously the same, just
using diﬀerent matrices. However the corresponding term for SRBP is given
by

(cid:2)

= NL × N1 + NL × N2 . . . NL × NL−1 = NL

W

k=L−1(cid:2)

Nk

(15)

k=1

In this sense, the computational complexity of BP and SRBP is identical if
all the layers have the same size, but it can be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent oth-
erwise, especially taking into consideration the tapering oﬀ associated with
most architectures used in practice. In a classiﬁcation problem, for instance,
NL = 1 and all the random matrices in SRBP have rank 1, and W
scales
like the total number of neurons, rather than the total number of forward
connections. Thus, provided it leads to eﬀective learning, SRBP could lead
to computational savings in a digital computer. However, in a physical neu-
ral system, in spite of these savings, the scaling complexity of BP and SRBP
could end up being the same. This is because in a physical neural system,
once the backpropagated signal has reached neuron i in layer h it still has to

(cid:2)

11

be communicated to the synapse. A physical model would have to specify the
cost of such communication. Assuming one unit cost, both BP and SRBP
would require Θ(W ) operations across the entire architecture. Finally, a full
analysis in a physical system would have to take into account also costs as-
sociated with wiring, and possibly diﬀerential costs between long and short
wires as, for instance, SRBP requires longer wires than standard BP or RBP.

4 Algorithm Simulations

In this section, we simulate the various algorithms using standard benchmark
datasets. The primary focus is not on achieving state-of-the-art results, but
rather on better understanding these new algorithms and where they break
down. The results are summarized in Table 1 at the end.

4.1 MNIST

Several learning algorithms were ﬁrst compared on the MNIST [22] clas-
siﬁcation task. The neural network architecture consisted of 784 inputs,
four fully-connected hidden layers of 100 tanh units, followed by 10 softmax
output units. Weights were initialized by sampling from a scaled normal
distribution [11]. Training was performed for 100 epochs using mini-batches
−6
of size 100 with an initial learning rate of 0.1, decaying by a factor of 10
after each update, and no momentum. In Figure 1, the performance of each
algorithm is shown on both the training set (60,000 examples) and test set
(10,000 examples). Results for the adaptive versions of the random propa-
gation algorithms are shown in Figure 2, and results for the sparse versions
are shown in Figure 3.

The main conclusion is that the general concept of RBP is very robust
and works almost as well as BP. Performance is unaﬀected or degrades grace-
fully when the the random backwards weights are initialized from diﬀerent
distributions or even change during training. The skipped versions of the al-
gorithms seem to work slightly better than the non-skipped versions. Finally,
it can be used with diﬀerent neuron activation functions, though multiplying
by the derivative of the activations seem to play an important role.

Figure 1: MNIST training (upper) and test (lower) accuracy, as a function
of epoch, for nine diﬀerent learning algorithms: backpropagation (BP), skip
BP (SBP), random BP (RBP), skip random BP (SRBP), the version of each
algorithm in which the error signal is not multiplied by the derivative of the
post-synaptic transfer function (no-f’), and the case where only the top layer
is trained while the lower layer weights are ﬁxed (Top Layer Only). Note
that these algorithms diﬀer only in how they backpropagate error signals to
the lower layers; the top layer is always updated according to the typical
gradient descent rule. Models are trained ﬁve times with diﬀerent weight
initializations; the trajectory of the mean is shown here.

Figure 2: MNIST training (upper) and test (lower) accuracy, as a function of
training epoch, for the adaptive versions of the RBP algorithm (ARBP) and
SRBP algorithm (ASRBP). In these simulations, adaption slightly improves
the performance of SRBP and speeds up training. For the ARBP algorithm,
the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.1 in these experiments to keep
the weights from growing too quickly. Models are trained ﬁve times with
diﬀerent weight initializations; the trajectory of the mean is shown here.

Figure 3: MNIST training (upper) and test (lower) accuracy, as a function
of training epoch, for the sparse versions of the RBP and SRBP algorithms.
Experiments are run with diﬀerent levels of sparsity by controlling the ex-
pected number n of non-zero connections sent from one neuron to any other
layer it is connected to in the backward learning channel. The random back-
propagation matrix connecting any two layers is created by sampling each
entry using a (0,1) Bernoulli distribution, where each element is 1 with prob-
ability p = n/(fan − in) and 0 otherwise. For example, in SRBP (Sparse-1),
each of the 10 softmax outputs sends a non-zero (hence with a weight equal
to 1) connection to an average of one neuron in each of the hidden layers.
We compare to the (Normal) versions of RBP and SRBP, where the elements
of these matrices are initialized from a standard Normal distribution scaled
in the same way as the forward weight matrices [11]. Models are trained
ﬁve times with diﬀerent weight initializations; the trajectory of the mean is
shown here.

Figure 4: MNIST post-training accuracy for the sparse versions of the SRBP
algorithm. For extreme values of n, sparse SRBP fails: for n = 0, all the
backward weights are set to zero and no error signals are sent; for n = 100 all
the backward weights are set to 1, and all the neurons in a given layer receive
the same error signal. The performance of the algorithm is surprisingly robust
in between these extremes. For sparse RBP (not shown), the backward
weights should be scaled by a factor of 1/
n to avoid an exponential growth
in the error signals of the lower layers.

4.2 Additional MNIST Experiments

In addition to the experiments presented above, the following observations
were made by training on MNIST with other variations of these algorithms:

1. If the matrices of the learning channel in RBP are randomly changed
at each stochastic mini-batch update, sampled from a distribution with
mean 0, performance is poor and similar to training only the top layer.

2. If the matrices of the learning channel in RBP are randomly changed
at each stochastic mini-batch update, but each backwards weight is

16

constrained to have the same sign as the corresponding forward weight,
then training error goes to 0%. This is the sign-concordance algorithm
explored by Liao, et al. [23].

3. If the elements of the matrices of the learning channel in RBP or SRBP
are sampled from a uniform or normal distribution with non-zero mean,
performance is unchanged. This is also consistent with the sparsity
experiments above, where the means of the sampling distributions are
not zero.

4. Updates to a deep layer with RBP or SRBP appear to require updates
in the precedent layers in the learning channel. If we ﬁx the weights in
layer h, while updating the rest of the layers with SRBP, performance
is often worse than if we ﬁx layers l ≤ h.

5. If we remove the magnitude information from the SRBP updates, keep-
ing only the sign, performance is better than the Top Layer Only algo-
rithm, but not as good as SRBP. This is further explored in the next
section.

6. If we remove the sign information from the SRBP updates, keeping

only the absolute value, things do not work at all.

7. If a diﬀerent random backward weight is used to send an error signal
to each individual weight, rather than to a hidden neuron which then
updates all it’s incoming weights, things do not work at all.

8. The RBP learning rules work with diﬀerent transfer functions as well,

including linear, logistic, and ReLU (rectiﬁed linear) units.

4.3 CIFAR-10

To further test the validity of these results, we performed similar simulations
with a convolutional architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset [20]. The speciﬁc
architecture was based on previous work [16], and consisted of 3 sets of
convolution and max-pooling layers, followed by a densely-connected layer of
1024 tanh units, then a softmax output layer. The input consists of 32-by-32
pixel 3-channel images; each convolution layer consists of 64 tanh channels
with 5x5 kernel shape and 1x1 strides; max-pooling layers have 3x3 receptive
ﬁelds and 2x2 strides. All weights were initialized by sampling from a scaled

17

normal distribution [11], and updated using stochastic gradient descent on
mini-batches of size 128 and a momentum of 0.9. The learning rate started
−5 after each update. During training,
at 0.01 and decreased by a factor of 10
the training images are randomly translated up to 10% in either direction,
horizontally and vertically, and ﬂipped horizontally with probability p = 0.5.
Examples of results obtained with these 2D convolutional architectures
are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Overall they are very similar to those obtained
on the MNIST dataset.

5 Bit Precision in the Learning Channel

5.1 Low-Precision Error Signals

In the following experiment, we investigate the nature of the learning channel
by quantizing the error signals in the BP, RBP, and SRBP algorithms. This is

distinct from other work that uses quantization to reduce computation [17] or
memory [13] costs. Quantization is not applied to the forward activations or
weights; quantization is only applied to the backpropagated signal received by
i (T−OL), where each weight update after quantization

in the non-quantized update. We deﬁne the quantization formula used here
as

Quantizeα,bits(x) = α × sign(x) × 2round(clip(log2| x

α

|, −bits+1, 0))

(19)

where bits is the number of bits needed to represent 2bits possible values and
α is a scale factor such that the quantized values fall in the range [−α, α].
Note that this deﬁnition is identical to the quantization function deﬁned in
Hubara, et al. [17], except that this deﬁnition is more general in that α is
not constrained to be a power of 2.

In BP and RBP, the quantization occurs before the error signal is back-
propagated to previous layers, so the quantization errors accumulate.
In
−3 and varied the bit
experiments, we used a ﬁxed scale parameter α = 2
width bits. Figure 7 shows that the performance degrades gracefully as the
precision of the error signal decreases to small values; for larger values, e.g.
bits = 10, the performance is indistinguishable from the unquantized updates
with 32-bit ﬂoats.

5.2 Low-Precision Weight Updates

The idea of using low-precision weight updates is not new [25], and Liao, et
al. [23] recently explored the use of low-precision updates with RBP. In the
following experiment, we investigate the robustness of both RBP and SRBP
to low-precision weight updates by controlling the degree of quantization.
Equation 19 is again used for quantization, with the scale factor reduced to
−6 since weight updates need to be small. The quantization is applied
α = 2
after the error signals have been backpropagated to all the hidden layers,
but before summing over the minibatch; as in the previous experiments, we
use minibatch updates of size 100, a non-decaying learning rate of 0.1, and
no momentum term (Figure 8). The main conclusion is that even very low-
precision updates to the weights can be used to train an MNIST classiﬁer to
90% accuracy, and that low-precision weight updates appear to degrade the
performance of BP, RBP, and SRBP in roughly the same way.

6 Observations

In this section, we provide a number of simple observations that provide some
intuition for some of the previous simulation results and why RBP and some
of its variations may work. Some of these observations are focused on SRBP
which in general is easier to study than standard RBP.
In all these RBPs algorithms, the L-layer at the top with parame-
Fact 1:
ters wL
ij follows the gradient, as it is trained just like BP, since there are no
random feedback weights used for learning in the top layer. In other words,
BP=RBP=SRBP for the top layer.
Fact 2: For a given input, if the sign of T −O is changed, all the weights up-
dates are changed in the opposite direction. This is true of all the algorithms
considered here–BP, RBP, and their variants–even when the derivatives of
the activations are included.
Fact 3: In all RBP algorithms, if T − O = 0 (online or in batch mode) then
for all the weights Δwh
Fact 4: Congruence of weights is not necessary. However it can be helpful
sometimes and speed up learning. This can easily be seen in simple cases.

For instance, consider a linear or non-linear A[N0, N1, 1] architecture with

ij = 0 (on line or in batch mode).

coherent weights, and denote by a the weights in the bottom layer, by b the
weights in the top layer, and by c the weights in the learning channel. Then,
for all variants of RBP, all the weights updates are in the same direction as
the gradient. This is obvious for the top layer (Fact 1 above). For the ﬁrst

layer of weights, the changes are given by Δw1
ij = η(T − O)biIj since
similar to the change produced by gradient descent Δ1
ci and bi are assumed to be coherent. So while the dynamics of the lower layer
is not exactly in the gradient direction, it is always in the same orthant as
the gradient and thus downhill with respect to the error function. Additional
examples showing the positive but not necessary eﬀect of coherence are given
in Section 7.
Fact 5: SRBP seems to perform well showing that the upper derivatives
are not needed. However the derivative of the corresponding layer seem
to matter.
In general, for the activation functions considered here, these
derivatives tend to be between 0 and 1. Thus learning is attenuated for
neurons that are saturated. So an ingredient that seems to matter is to let
the synapses of neurons that are not saturated change more than the synapses
of neurons that are saturated (f

the elements in the same class tend to receive the same backpropagated
signal and tend to move in unison. For instance, consider the the beginning
of learning, with small random weights in the forward network. Then all the
images will tend to produce a more or less uniform output vector similar to
(0.1, 0.1, . . . , 0.1). Thus all the images in the “0” class will tend to produce
a more or less uniform error vector similar to (0.9,−0.1, . . . ,−0.1). All the
images in the “1” class will tend to produce a more or less uniform error
vector similar to (−0.1, 0.9, . . . ,−0.1), which is essentially orthogonal to the
previous error vector, and so forth. In other words, the 10 classes can be
associated with 10 roughly orthogonal error vectors. When these vectors are
multiplied by a ﬁxed random matrix, as in SRBP, they will tend to produce
10 approximately orthogonal vectors in the corresponding hidden layer. Thus
the backpropagated error signals tend to be similar within one digit class,
and orthogonal across diﬀerent digit classes. At the beginning of learning,
we can expect roughly half of them (5 digits out of 10 in the MNIST case)
to be in the same direction as BP.

Thus, in conclusion, an intuitive picture of why RBP may work is that:
(1) the random weights introduce a ﬁxed coupling between the learning dy-
namics of the forward weights (see also mathematical analyses below); (2)
the top layer of weights always follows gradient descent and stirs the learning
dynamic in the right direction; and (3) the learning dynamic tends to cluster
inputs associated with the same response and move them away from other
similar clusters. Next we discuss a possible connection to dropout.

6.1 Connections to Dropout

Dropout [16, 5] is a very diﬀerent training algorithm which, however, is also
based on using some form of randomness. Here we explore some possible
connections to RBP.

First observe that the BP equations can be viewed as a form of dropout
averaging equations, in the sense that, for a ﬁxed example, they compute
the ensemble average activity of all the units in the learning channel. The
ensemble average is taken over all the possible backpropagation networks
where each unit is dropped stochastically, unit i in layer h being dropped
with probability 1 − f
o ) [ assuming the derivatives of the transfer func-
tions are always between 0 and 1 inclusively, which is the case for the stan-
dard transfer functions, such as the logistic or the rectiﬁed linear transfer
functions–otherwise some rescaling is necessary]. Note that in this way the

(Sh

(cid:2)

27

dropout probabilities change with each example and units that are more sat-
urated are more likely to be dropped, consistently with the remark above
that saturated units should learn less.

In this view there are two kinds of noise: (1) choice of the dropout prob-
abilities which vary with each example; (2) the actual dropout procedure.
Consider now adding a third type of noise on all the symmetric weights in
the backward pass in the form

wh

ij + ξh
ij

(20)

and assume for now that E(ξh
ij) = 0. The distribution of the noise could be
Gaussian for instance, but this is not essential. The important point is that
the noise on a weight is independent of the noise on the other weights, as well
as independent of the dropout noise on the units. Under these assumptions,
as shown in [5], the expected value of the activity of each unit in the backward
pass is exactly given by the standard BP equations and equal to Bh
i for unit
In other words, standard backpropagation can be viewed as
i in layer h.
computing the exact average over all backpropagation processes implemented
on all the stochastic realizations of the backward network under the three
forms of noise described above. Thus we can reverse this argument and
consider that RBP approximates this average or BP by averaging over the
ﬁrst two kinds of noise, but not the third one where, instead of averaging, a
random realization of the weights is selected and then ﬁxed at all epochs. This
connection suggests other intermediate RBP variants where several samples
of the weights are used, rather than a single one.

Finally, it is possible to use dropout in the backward pass. The forward
pass is robust to dropping out neurons, and in fact the dropout procedure
can be beneﬁcial [16, 5]. Here we apply the dropout procedure to neurons in
the learning channel during the backward pass. The results of simulations
are reported in Figure 9 and conﬁrm that BP, RBP, SRBP, are robust with
respect to dropout.

7 Mathematical Analysis

7.1 General Considerations

The general strategy to try to derive more precise mathematical results is to
proceed from simple architectures to more complex architectures, and from
the linear case to the non-linear case. The linear case is more amenable to
analysis and, in this case, RBP and SRBP are equivalent when there is only
one hidden layer, or when all the layers have the same size. Thus we study the
convergence of RBP to optimal solutions in linear architectures of increasing
complexity: A[1, 1, 1], A[1, 1, 1, 1], A[1, 1, . . . , 1], A[1, N, 1] A[N, 1, N ], and
then the general A[N 0, N 1, N 2] case with a single hidden layer. This is
followed by the study of a non-linear A[1, 1, 1] case.

For each kind of linear network, under a set of standard assumptions,
one ca derive a set of non-linear–in fact polynomial–autonomous, ordinary
diﬀerential equations (ODEs) for the average (or batch) time evolution of the
synaptic weights under the RBP or SRBP algorithm. As soon as there is more
than one variable and the system is non-linear, there is no general theory to
understand the corresponding behavior.
In fact, even in two dimensions,
the problem of understanding the upper bound on the number and relative
position of the limit cycles of a system of the form dx/dt = P (x, y) and
dy/dt = Q(x, y), where P and Q are polynomials of degree n is open–in fact
this is Hilbert’s 16-th problem in the ﬁeld of dynamical systems [29, 19].

When considering the speciﬁc systems arising from the RBP/SRBP learn-
ing equations, one must ﬁrst prove that these systems have a long-term so-
lution. Note that polynomial ODEs may not have long-term solutions (e.g.
dx/dt = xα, with x(0) (cid:6)= 0, does not have long-term solutions for α > 1).
If the trajectories are bounded, then long-term solutions exist. We are par-
ticularly interested in long-term solutions that converge to a ﬁxed point, as
opposed to limit cycles or other behaviors.

A number of interesting cases can be reduced to polynomial diﬀerential
equations in one dimension. These can be understood using the following
theorem.

Theorem 1: Let dx/dt = Q(x) = k0 + k1x + . . . + knxn be a ﬁrst order
polynomial diﬀerential equation in one dimension of degree n >1, and let
r1 < r2 . . . < rk (k ≤ n) be the ordered list of distinct real roots of Q (the

ﬁxed points).

If x(0) = ri then x(t) =r i and the solution is constant If

30

ri < x(0) < ri+1 then x(t) → ri if Q < 0 in (ri, ri+1), and x(t) → ri+1 if
Q >0 in ( ri, ri+1). If x(0) < r1 and Q >0 in the corresponding interval, then
x(t) → r1. Otherwise, if Q <0 in the corresponding interval, there is no long
time solution and x(t) diverges to −∞ within a ﬁnite horizon. If x(0) > rk
and Q <0 in the corresponding interval, then x(t) → rk. Otherwise, if Q >0
in the corresponding interval, there is no long time solution and x(t) diverges
to +∞ within a ﬁnite horizon. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the
dynamics to always converge to a ﬁxed point is that the degree n be odd, and
the leading coeﬃcient be negative.

Proof: The proof of this theorem is easy and can be visualized by plotting
the function Q.

Finally, in general the matrices in the forward channel are denoted by
A1, A2, . . . , and the matrices in the learning channel are denoted by C1, C2, . . .
Theorems are stated in concise form and additional important facts are con-
tained in the proofs.

Derivation of the System: The simplest case correspond to a linear

7.2 The Simplest Linear Chain: A[1, 1, 1]
A[1, 1, 1] architecture (Figure 10). Let us denote by a1 and a2 the weights
in the ﬁrst and second layer, and by c1 the random weight of the learning
channel. In this case, we have O(t) =a 1a2I(t) and the learning equations

are given by: (cid:5)

(21)

(22)

Δa1 = ηc1(T − O)I = ηc1(T − a1a2I)I
Δa2 = η(T − O)a1I = η(T − a1a2I)a1I

(cid:5)

When averaged over the training set:

E(Δa1) = ηc1E(IT ) − ηc1a1a2E(I 2) = ηc1α − ηc1a1a2β
E(Δa2) = ηa1E(IT ) − ηa2

1a2E(I 2) = ηa1α − ηa2

1a2β

where α = E(IT ) andβ = E(I 2). With the proper scaling of the learning
rate (η = Δt) this leads to the non-linear system of coupled diﬀerential
equations for the temporal evolution of a1 and a2 during learning:

(cid:5)

Theorem 2: The system in Equation 23 always converges to a ﬁxed point.
Furthermore, except for trivial cases associated with c1 = 0, starting from
any initial conditions the system converges to a ﬁxed point corresponding to
a global minimum of the quadratic error function. All the ﬁxed points are
located on the hyperbolas given by α − βP = 0 and are global minima of
the error function. All the ﬁxed points are attractors except those that are
interior to a certain parabola. For any starting point, the ﬁnal ﬁxed point
can be calculated by solving a cubic equation.

Proof: As this is the ﬁrst example, we ﬁrst deal with the trivial cases in
detail. For subsequent systems, we will skip the trivial cases entirely.
Trivial Cases: 1) If β = 0 then we must have I = 0 and thus α = 0. As a
result the activity of the input, hidden, and output, neuron will always be 0.
Therefore the weights a1 and a2 will remain constant (da1/dt = da2/dt = 0)
and equal to their initial values a1(0) and a2(0). The error will also remain
constant, and equal to 0 if and only if T = 0. Thus from now on we can
assume that β > 0.
2) If c1 = 0 then the lower weight a1 never changes and remains equal to its
initial value. If this initial value satisﬁes a1(0) = 0, then the activity of the
hidden and output unit remains equal to 0 at all times, and thus a2 remains
constant and equal to its initial value a2 = a2(0). The error remains constant
and equal to 0 if only if T is always 0. If a1(0) (cid:6)= 0, then the error is a simple

32

quadratic convex function of a2 and since the rule for adjusting a2 is simply
gradient descent, the value of a2 will converge to its optimal value given by:
a2 = α/βa1(0).
General Case: Thus from now on, we can assume that β > 0 and c1 (cid:6)= 0.

Furthermore, it is easy to check that changing the sign of α corresponds to
a reﬂection about the a2-axis. Likewise, changing the sign of c1 corresponds
to a reﬂection about the origin (i.e. across both the a1 and a2 axis). Thus in
short, it is suﬃcient to focus on the case where: α > 0, β > 0, and c1 > 0.
In this case, the critical points for a1 and a2 are given by:

P = a1a2 =

α
β

=

E(IT )
E(I 2)

= 0

(27)

which corresponds to two hyperbolas in the two-dimensional (a1, a2) plane,
in the ﬁrst and third quadrant for α = E(IT ) > 0. Note that these critical
points do not depend on the feedback weight c1. All these critical points corre-
spond to global minima of the error function E = 1
the critical points of P include also the parabola:

2 E[(T −O)2]. Furthermore,

a2
1 + a2c1 = 0

or a2 = −a2

1/c1

(28)

(Figure 11). These critical points are dependent on the weights in the learning
channel. This parabola intersects the hyperbola a1a2 = P = α/β at one point
with coordinates: a1 = (−c1α/β)1/3 and a2 = (−α2/3/(c1/3

1 β2/3).

In the upper half plane, where a2 and c1 are congruent and both positive,
the dynamics is simple to understand. For instance in the ﬁrst quadrant
where a1, a2, c1 > 0, if α − βP > 0 thenda 1/dt > 0, da2/dt > 0, and

dP/dt > 0 everywhere and therefore the gradient vector ﬂow is directed
If started in this region, a1, a2,
towards the hyperbola of critical points.
and P will grow monotonically until a critical point is reached and the error
will decrease monotonically towards a global minimum. If α − βP < 0 then
da1/dt < 0, da2/dt < 0, and dP/dt < 0 everywhere and again the vector ﬂow
is directed towards the hyperbola of critical points. If started in this region,
a1, a2, and P will decrease monotonically until a critical point is reached and
the error will decrease monotonically towards a global minimum. A similar
situation is observed in the fourth quadrant where a1 < 0 and a2 > 0.

More generally, if a2 and c1 have the same sign, i.e. are congruent as in
1 + a2c1 ≥ 0 and P will increase if α − βP > 0, and decrease
BP, then a2
if α − βP < 0. Note however that this is also true in general when c1 is

small regardless of its sign, relative to a1 and a2, since in this case it is still
true that a2
1 + a2c1 is positive. This remains true even if c1 varies, as long as
it is small. When c1 is small, the dynamics is dominated by the top layer.

34

The lower layer changes slowly and the top layer adapts rapidly so that the
system again converges to a global minimum. When a2 = c1 one recovers the
convergent dynamic of BP, as dP/dt always has the same sign as α − βP .
However, in the lower half plane, the situation is slightly more complicated
(Figure 11).

To solve the dynamics in the general case, from Equation 23 we get:

Given a starting point a1(0) and a2(0), the system will follow a trajectory
given by the parabola in Equation 30 until it converges to a critical point
(global optimum) where da1/dt = da2/dt = 0. To ﬁnd the speciﬁc criti-
cal point to which it converges to, Equations 30 and 27 must be satisﬁed
simultaneously which leads to the depressed cubic equation:

1 + (2c1a2(0) − a1(0)2)a1 − 2
a3

c1α
β

= 0

(31)

which can be solved using the standard formula for the roots of cubic equa-
tions. Note that the parabolic trajectories contained in the upper half plane
intersect the critical hyperbola in only one point and therefore the equation
has a single real root. In the lower half plane, the parabolas associated with
the trajectories can intersect the hyperbolas in 1, 2, or 3 distinct points cor-
responding to 1 real root, 2 real roots (1 being double), and 3 real roots. The

double root corresponds to the point −(c1α/β)1/3 associated with the inter-

section of the parabola of Equation 30 with both the hyperbola of critical
points a1a2 = α/β and the parabola of additional critical points for P given
by Equation 28.

When there are multiple roots, the convergence point of each trajectory is
easily identiﬁed by looking at the derivative vector ﬂow (Figure 11). Note on
the ﬁgure that all the points on the critical hyperbolas are stable attractors,
except for those in the lower half-plane that satisfy both a1a2 = α/β and
a2c1 + a2
1 < 0. This can be shown by linearizing the system around its
critical points.

35

Linearization Around Critical Points. If we consider a small deviation

a1 + u and a2 + v around a critical point a1, a2 (satisfying α − βa1a2 = 0)

and linearize the corresponding system, we get:

dt = −βc1(a2u + a1v)
dt = −βa1(a2u + a1v)
with a1a2 = α/β. If we letw = a2u + a1v we have:

Thus if β(c1a2 + a2
1) > 0, w converges to zero and a1, a2 is an attractor.
In particular, this is always the case when c1 is very small, or c1 has the
1) < 0, w diverges to +∞, and corresponds to
same sign as a2. If β(c1a2 + a2
unstable critical points as described above. If β(c1a2 +a2
1) = 0, w is constant.
Finally, note that in many cases, for instance for trajectories in the up-
per half plane, the value of P along the trajectories increases or decreases
monotonically towards the global optimum value. However this is not always
the case and there are trajectories where dP/dt changes sign, but this can
happen only once.

7.3 Adding Depth: the Linear Chain A[1, 1, 1, 1].
Derivation of the System: In the case of a linear A[1, 1, 1, 1] architecture,
for notational simplicity, let us denote by a1, a2 and a3 the forward weights,
and by c1 and c2 the random weights of the learning channel (note the index
is equal to the target layer). In this case, we have O(t) = a1a2a3I(t) = P I(t).
The learning equations are:

⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩Δa1 = ηc1(T − O)I = ηc1(T − a1a2a3I)I

Δa2 = ηc2(T − O)a1I = ηc2(T − a1a2a3I)a1I
Δa3 = η(T − O)a1a2I = η(T − a1a2a3I)a1a2I

When averaged over the training set:

⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩E(Δa1) = ηc1E(IT ) − ηc1P E(I 2) = ηc1α − ηc1P β

E(Δa2) = ηc2a1E(IT ) − ηc2a1P E(I 2) = ηc2a1α − ηc2a1P β
E(Δa3) = ηa1a2E(IT ) − ηa1a2P E(I 2) = ηa1a2β − ηa1a2P β

Theorem 3: Except for trivial cases (associated with c1 = 0 or c2 = 0),
starting from any initial conditions the system in Equation 36 converges to
a ﬁxed point, corresponding to a global minimum of the quadratic error
function. All the ﬁxed points are located on the hypersurface given by α −
βP = 0 and are global minima of the error function. Along any trajectory,
and for each i, ai+1 is a quadratic function of ai. For any starting point, the
ﬁnal ﬁxed point can be calculated by solving a polynomial equation of degree
seven.

Proof: If c1 = 0, a1 remains constant and thus we are back to the linear case
of a A[1, 1, 1] architecture where the inputs I are replaced by a1I. Likewise,
if c2 = 0 a2 remains constant and the problem can again be reduced to the
A[1, 1] case with the proper adjustments. Thus for the rest of this section
we can assume c1 (cid:6)= 0 and c2 (cid:6)= 0.
The critical points of the system correspond to α − βP = 0 and do
not depend on the weights in the learning channel. These critical points
correspond to global minima of the error function. These critical points are
also critical points for the product P . Additional critical points for P are
provided by the hypersurface: a2
1a3 = 0 with (a1, a2, a3) in
R3.

In short da1/dt = Q(a1) whereQ is a polynomial of degree 7 in a1. By
expanding and simplifying Equation 42, it is easy to see that the leading
term of Q is negative and given by βc2
1). Therefore, using Theorem 1,
for any initial conditions a1(0), a1(t) converges to a ﬁnite ﬁxed point. Since
a2 is a quadratic function of a1 it also converges to a ﬁnite ﬁxed point, and
similarly for a3. Thus in the general case the system always converges to a
global minimum of the error function satisfying α−βP = 0. The hypersurface
a2
1a2
1a3 = 0 depends on c1, c2 and provides additional critical
points for the product P . It can be shown again by linearization that this
hypersurface separates stable from unstable ﬁxed points.

is small and c2 is congruent (with a3), then a2
1a3 > 0 and
dP/dt has the same sign as α − βP .

system in Equation 44 converges to a ﬁxed point, corresponding to a global
minimum of the quadratic error function. All the ﬁxed points are located on
the hypersurface given by α − βP = 0 and are global minima of the error
function. Along any trajectory, and for each i, ai+1 is a quadratic function of
ai. For any starting point, the ﬁnal ﬁxed point can be calculated by solving
a polynomial equation of degree 2L − 1.

Proof: Again, when all the weights in the learning channel are non zero,
the critical points correspond to the curve α − βP = 0. These critical
points are independent of the weights in the learning channel and corre-
spond to global minima of the error function. Additional critical points for
the product P = a1 . . . aL are given by the surface
k=1 ak = 0.
These critical points are dependent on the weights in the learning channel.
If the ci are small or congruent with the respective feedforward weights, then
aj] > 0 and dP/dt has the same sign as α − βP .
Thus small or congruent weights can help the learning but they are not nec-
essary.

Note that if one the derivatives dai/dt is zero, then they are all zero and thus
there cannot be any limit cycles. Since in the general case all the ci are non

(48)

showing that there is a quadratic relationship between ai+1 and ai, with no
linear term, for every i. Thus every ai can be expressed as a polynomial
function of a1 of degree 2i−1, containing only even terms:

ai = k0 + k1a2

By substituting these relationships in the equation for the derivative of a1,
we get da1/dt = Q(a1) whereQ is a polynomial with an odd degree n given
by:

n = 1 + 2 + 4 +. . . + 2L−1 = 2L − 1

(51)

Furthermore, from Equation 50 it can be seen that leading coeﬃcient is
negative therefore, using Theorem 1, for any set of initial conditions the
system must converge to a ﬁnite ﬁxed point. For a given initial condition,
the point of convergence can be solved by looking at the nearby roots of the
polynomial Q of degree n.

tions are:

Derivation of the System: Consider a linear A[1, N, 1] architecture (Fig-
ure 13). For notational simplicity, we let a1, . . . , aN be the weights in the
(cid:12)
lower layer, b1, . . . , bN be the weights in the upper layer, and c1, . . . , cN
the random weights of the learning channel. In this case, we have O(t) =

(cid:12)

i aibiI(t). We let P =

i aibi. The learning equations are:

Δai = ηci(T − O)I = ηci(T −(cid:12)
Δbi = η(T − O)aiI = η(T −(cid:12)

i aibiI)I

When averaged over the training set:

(cid:5)

E(Δai) = ηciE(IT ) − ηciP E(I 2) = ηciα − ηciP β
E(Δbi) = ηaiE(IT ) − ηaiP E(I 2) = ηaiα − ηaiP β

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

where α = E(IT ) andβ = E(I 2). With the proper scaling of the learning
rate (η = Δt) this leads to the non-linear system of coupled diﬀerential
equations for the temporal evolution of ai and bi during learning:

Theorem 5: Except for trivial cases, starting from any initial conditions the
system in Equation 57 converges to a ﬁxed point, corresponding to a global
minimum of the quadratic error function. All the ﬁxed points are located
on the hyersurface given by α − βP = 0 and are global minima of the error
function. Along any trajectory, each bi is a quadratic polynomial function
of ai. Each ai is an aﬃne function of any other aj.For any starting point,
the ﬁnal ﬁxed point can be calculated by solving a polynomial diﬀerential
equation of degree 3.

Proof: Many of the features found in the linear chain are found again in
this system using similar analyses.
In the general case where the weights

43

in the learning channel are non zero, the critical points are given by the
surface α − βP = 0 and correspond to global optima. These critical points
are independent of the weights in the learning channel. Additional critical
points for the product P =
i + bici = 0
which depends on the weights in the learning channel. If the ci’s are small,
or congruent with the respective bi’s, then
i + bici > 0 anddP/dt has
the same sign as α − βP .

i aibi are given by the surface

To address the convergence, Equations 57 leads to the vertical coupling

between ai and bi:

ai

or

bi =

2ci

a2
i + Ci

(59)

for each i = 1, . . . , N . Thus the dynamics of the ai variables completely
determines the dynamics of the bi variables, and one only needs to understand
the behavior of thea i variables. In addition to the vertical coupling between
ai and bi, there is an horizontal coupling between the ai variables given again
by Equation 57 resulting in:

dai+1

dt

=

ci+1
ci

dai

or ai+1 =

ci+1

ai + Ki+1

(60)

Thus, iterating, all the variables ai can be expressed as aﬃne functions of a1
in the form:

ai =

(cid:2)
a1 + K
i

ci
c1

i = 1, . . . , N

(61)

Thus solving the entire system can be reduced to solving for a1. The diﬀeren-
tial equation for a1 is of the form da1/dt = Q(a1) where Q is a polynomial of
degree 3. Its leading term, is the leading term of −c1βP . To ﬁnd its leading

term we have:

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

P =

Thus the leading term of Q has a negative coeﬃcient, and therefore a1 always

small learning rate, leads to the system of diﬀerential equations:

dA

dt = C(ΣT I − BAΣII)
dt = (ΣT I − BAΣII)At

(65)
Here A is an 1 × N matrix, B is an N × 1 matrix, and C is an 1 × N
matrix, and M t denotes the transpose of the matrix M . ΣII = E(II t) and
ΣT I = E(T I t) areN × N matrices associated with the data.

satisﬁes:

Theorem 6: In the case of an autoencoder with uncorrelated normalized
data (Equation 68), the system converges to a ﬁxed point satisfying A = βC,
where β is a positive root of a particular cubic equation. At the ﬁxed point,
B = C t/(β||C||2) and the product P = BA converges to C tC/||C||2.

Proof: For an autoencoder with uncorrelated and normalized data (ΣT I =
ΣII = Id). In this case the system can be written as:

(cid:5)

dt = C(Id − BA)
dt = (Id − BA)At

We deﬁne

and let A0 = A(0). Note that σ(t) ≥ K. We assume that C and A0 are

linearly independent, otherwise the proof is easier. Then we have:

= C − σ(t)A

Therefore the solution A(t) must have the form:

which yields:

A(t) = f (t)C + g(t)A0

(t) = −σ(t)g(t),

(75)

By a more general theorem shown in the next section, we know also that
||A|| is bounded and therefore f is also bounded. Using Equation 74, this
implies that that g(t) → 0 ast → ∞. Now we consider again the equation:

Now consider the cubic equation:

(cid:2)

f

= 1 − σf

For t large enough, since g(t) → 0, we have:

1 − (

t2||C||2 + K)t = 0

σ(t) ≈ 1

h2||C||2 + K)h

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

By Theorem 1, this system is always convergent to a positive root of Equation
77, and by comparison the system in Equation 76 must converge as well. This
proves that f (t) → β as t → ∞, and in combination with g(t) → 0 ast → ∞,
shows that A converges to βC. As A converges to a ﬁxed point, the error
function converges to a convex function and B performs gradient descent
on this convex function and thus must also approach a ﬁxed point. By the

47

results in [2, 3], the solution must satisfy BAAt = At. When A = βC this
gives: B = C t/(βCC t) =C t/(β||C||2). In this case, the product P = BA
converges to the ﬁxed point: C tC/||C||2. The proof can easily be adapted to
the slightly more general case where ΣII is a diagonal matrix.

7.7 The General Linear Case: A[N0, N1, . . . , NL]

Derivation of the System: Although we cannot yet provide a solution
for this case, it is still useful to derive its equations. We assume a general

feedforward linear architecture (Figure 14) A[N0, N1, . . . , NL] with adjustable
forward matrices A1, . . . , AL and ﬁxed feedback matrices C1, . . . , CL−1 (and
CL = Id). Each matrix Ai is of size Ni × Ni−1 and, in SRBP, each matrix Ci
is of size Ni × NL. As usual, O(t) = P I(t) = (

(cid:11)L

i=1 Ai)I(t).

Figure 14: General linear case with an architecture A[N0, . . . , NL]. Each
forward matrix Ai is adjustable and of size Ni×Ni−1. In SRBP, each feedback
matrices Ci is ﬁxed and of size Ni × NL.

Assuming the same learning rate everywhere, using matrix notation we

have:

ΔAi = ηCi(T − O)(Ai−1 . . . A1I)t = ηCi(T − O)I tAt

(81)

with P = ALAL−1 . . . A1, ΣT I = E(T I t), and ΣII = E(II t). ΣT I is a NL×N0
matrix and ΣII is a N0 × N0 matrix. In the case of an autoencoder, T = I

and therefore ΣT I = ΣII. Equation 81 is true also for i = 1 and i = L
with CL = Id where Id is the identity matrix. These equations establish a
coupling between the layers so that:

dAi+1

7.8 The General Three-Layer Linear Case A[N0, N1, N2].
Derivation of the System: Here we let A1 be the N1 × N0 matrix of
weights in the lower layer, A2 be N2 × N1 matrix of weights in the upper
layer, and C1 the N1 × N2 random matrix of weights in the learning channel.
In this case, we have O(t) = A2A1I(t) = P I(t)) and ΣII = E(II t) (N0× N0),
and ΣT I = E(T I t) (N2 × N1). The learning equations are given by:

The corresponding gradient descent equations are obtained immediately by

Note that the two-layer linear case corresponds to the classical Least
Square Method which is well understood. The general theory of the three-
layer linear case, however, is not well understood. In this section, we take
a signiﬁcant step towards providing a complete treatment of this case. One
of the main results is that system deﬁned by Equation 88 has long-term
existence, and C1P = C1A2A1 is convergent and thus, in short, the system
is able to learn. However this alone does not imply that the matrix valued
functions A1(t), A2(t) are individually convergent. We can prove the latter in
special cases like A[N, 1, N ] andA[1, N, 1] studied in the previous sections,
as well as A[2, 2, 2].

We begin with the following theorem.

50

Theorem 7: The general three layer linear system (Equation 88) always has

long-term solutions. Moreover ||A1|| is bounded.

f . Note that it is not possible for f to be increasing as t → ∞ because if
2 c1f 2 ≥ 0 and thus f would be

for some constants c1, c2 > 0.

To complete the proof of Theorem 7, we must estimate A2 to make sure it
does not diverge at a ﬁnite time. Let

(109)
is monotonically decreasing. Since A1 is bounded by Theorem 7, and A2AT

is nonnegative, the expression is convergent.
In particular, C1A2 is also
bounded along the ﬂow. By the (108), both A1 and C1A2 are L2 integrable.
Thus in fact we have pointwise convergence of C1A2A1. Since C1 may not be
full rank, we call it partial convergence. If C1 has full rank (which in general
is the case of interest), then as C1A2A1 is convergent, so is A2A1.

is discrete, then A1(t) and C1A2(t) are convergent.

Proof. By the proof of Theorem 8, we know that A1(t), C1A2(t) are
bounded, and the limiting points of the pair (A1(t), C1A2(t)) satisfy the re-
lationships in Equation 110. If the set is discrete, then the limit must be be
unique and A1(t) and C1A2(t) converge.

If C1 has full rank, then the system in Equation (88) is convergent, if the
assumptions in Theorem 9 are satisﬁed. Applying this result to the A[1, N, 1]
and A[N, 1, N ] cases, provides alternative proofs for Theorem 3 and Theo-
rem 6. The details are omitted. Beyond these two cases, the algebraic set

54

deﬁned by Equation (110) is quite complicated to study. The ﬁrst non-trivial
case that can be analyzed corresponds to the A[2, 2, 2] architecture. In this
special case, we we can solve the convergence problem entirely as follows.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that ΣII = ΣT I = C1 = I. Then

the system associated with Equation (88) can be simpliﬁed to:

dA

(111)
where A(t), B(t) are 2 × 2 matrix functions. By Theorem 7, we know that
B(t)A(t) is convergent. In order to prove that B(t) and A(t) are individually
convergent, we prove the following result.
Theorem 10: Let F be the set of 2 × 2 matrices A, B satisfying the equa-
tions:

(cid:5)

dB

dt = (I − BA)At
dt = (I − BA)

B + BT − AAT = K
A + AT − BBT = L
AB = I

(112)

where K, L are ﬁxed matrices. Then F is a discrete set and the system
deﬁned by Equation 111 is convergent.

Proof: The proof is somewhat long and technical and thus is given in the
Appendix. It uses basic tools from algebraic geometry.

Theorem 10 provides evidence that in general the algebraic set deﬁned
by Equation (110) might be discrete. Although at this moment we are not
able to prove discreteness in the general case, this is a question of separate
interest in mathematics (real algebraic geometry). The system deﬁned by
Equation (110) is an over-determined system of algebraic equations. For
example, if A(t), B(t) aren × n matrices, and if C is non-singular, then the
system contains n(n + 1) equations with n2 unknowns. One can deﬁne the
Koszul complex [9] associated with these equations Using the complex, given
speciﬁc matrices C, ΣT I, ΣII, K, L, there is a constructive algorithmic way to
determine whether the set is discrete. If it is, then the corresponding system
of ODE is convergent. 1

7.9 A Non-Linear Case

As can be expected, the case of non-linear networks is challenging to analyze
mathematically.
In the linear case, the transfer functions are the identity
and thus all the derivatives of the transfer functions are equal to 1 and thus
play no role. The simulations reported above provide evidence that in the
non-linear case the derivatives of the activation functions play a role in both
RBP and SRBP. Here we study a very simple non-linear case which provides
some further evidence.
We consider a simple A[1, 1, 1] architecture, with a single power function
non linearity with power μ (cid:6)= 1 in the hidden layer, so that O1(S) = (S1)μ.
The ﬁnal output neuron is linear O2(S2) =S 2 and thus the overall input-
output relationship is: O = a2(a1I)μ. Setting μ to 1/3, for instance, provides
an S-shaped transfer function for the hidden layer, and setting μ = 1 corre-
sponds to the linear case analyzed in a previous section. The weights are a1
and a2 in the forward network, and c1 in the learning channel.

Derivation of the System Without Derivatives:

When no derivatives are included, one obtains:

(cid:5)

1 [E(T I μ) − a2aμ
dt = aμ
da2
dt = c1[E(T I) − a2aμ
da1

1 (α − βa2aμ
1 E(μI 2)] = aμ
1 )
1 E(I μ+1)] = c1(γ − δa2aμ
1 )

(113)

where here α = E(T I μ), β = E(I 2μ), γ = E(T I), and δ = E(I μ+1). Except
for trivial cases, such a system cannot have ﬁxed points since in general one
cannot have a2aμ

1 = γ/δ at the same time.

1 = α/β and a2aμ

Derivation of the System With Derivatives:

In contrast, when the derivative of the forward activation is included the

system becomes:

(cid:5)

1 [E(T I μ) − a2aμ

dt = aμ
da2
dt = c1μaμ−1
da1

1 E(I 2μ)] = aμ
1 E(T I μ) − a2c1μa2μ−1

1 (α − βa2aμ
1 )
1 E(I 2μ) = aμ−1

1

c1μ(α − βa2aμ
1 )

This leads to the coupling:

a1

da1
dt

= c1μ

da2
dt

or a2 =

a2
1
2c1μ

+ K

(114)

(115)

56

excluding as usual the trivial cases where c1 = 0 or μ = 0. Here K is a
constant depending only on a1(0) and a2(0). The coupling shows that if
da1/dt = 0 then da2/dt = 0 and therefore in general limit cycles are not
possible. The critical points are given by the equation:

α − βa2aμ

1 = 0

or a2 =

α
βaμ
1

(116)

and do not depend on the weight in the learning channel. Thus, in the non-
trivial cases, a2 is an hyperbolic function of aμ
1 . It is easy to see, at least in
some cases, that the system converges to a ﬁxed point. For instance, when
α > 0, c1 > 0, μ >1, and a1(0) and a2(0) are small and positive, then
da1/dt > 0 and da2/dt > 0 and both derivatives are monotonically increas-
ing and α − βa2aμ
1 decreases monotonically until convergence to a critical
point.Thus in general the system including the derivatives of the forward
activations is simpler and better behaved. In fact, we have a more general
theorem.

Theorem 12: Assume that α > 0, β > 0 c1 > 0, and μ ≥ 1. Then for
any positive initial values a1(0) ≥ 0 and a2(0) ≥ 0, the system described by

Equation 114 is convergent to one of the positive roots of the equation for t:

α − β(

t2

2c1μ

+ K)tμ = 0

(117)

Proof: Using Equation 115, the diﬀerential equation for a1 can be rewritten
as:

da1
dt

= μaμ−1

1

c1(α − β(

a2
1
2c1μ

+ K)aμ

1 ) = Q(a1)

(118)

When μ is an integer, Q(a1) is a polynomial of odd degree with a leading
coeﬃcient that is negative and therefore, using Theorem 1, the system is
convergent. If μ is not an integer, let r1 < . . . < rk be the positive roots of
the function Q. The proof then proceeds similarly to the proof of Theorem
1. That is this diﬀerential equation (Equation 118) is convergent to one of
the (non-negative) roots of Q(t). However, since a1(0) > 0, a more careful
analysis shows that it is not for a1 to converge to zero. Thus a1 must converge
to a positive root of Equation 117.

57

Gradient Descent Equations: Finally, for comparison, in the case of
gradient descent, the system is given by:

(cid:5)

dt = aμ
da2
dt = a2μaμ−1
da1

1 [E(T I μ) − a2aμ

1 E(T I μ) − a2

1 E(I 2μ)] = aμ

1 (α − βa2aμ
1 )
1 a2μ(α − βa2aμ
1 E(I 2μ) = aμ−1
1 )

2μa2μ−1

(119)

Except for trivial cases, the critical points are again given by Equation 116,
and the system always converges to a critical point.

8 Conclusion

Training deep architectures with backpropagation on digital computers is
useful for practical applications, and it has become easier than ever, in part
because of the creation of software packages with automatic diﬀerentiation
capabilities. This convenience, however, can be misleading as it hampers
thinking about the constraints of learning in physical neural systems, which
are merely being mimicked on digital computers. Thinking about learning
in physical systems is useful in many ways:
it leads to the notion of lo-
cal learning rules, which in turn identiﬁes two fundamental problems facing
backpropagation in physical systems. First backpropagation is not local, and
thus a learning channel is required to communicate error information from
the output layer to the deep weights. Second, backpropagation requires sym-
metric weights, a signiﬁcant challenge for those physical systems that cannot
use the forward channel in the reverse direction, thus requiring a diﬀerent
pathway to communicate errors to the deep weights.

RBP is one mode for communicating information over the learning chan-
nel, that completely bypasses the need for symmetric weights, by using ﬁxed
random weights instead. However RBP is only one possibility among many
other ones for harnessing randomness in the learning channel. Here we have
derived several variants of RBP and studied them through simulations and
mathematical analyses. Additional variants are studied in a followup pa-
per [4] which considers additional symmetry issues such as having a learning
channel with an architecture that is not a symmetric version of the forward
architecture, or having non-linear units in the learning channel that are sim-
ilar to the non-linear units of the forward architecture.

In combination, the main emerging picture is that the general concept of
RBP is remarkably robust as most of the variants lead to robust learning.

58

RBP and its many variants do not seem to have a practical role in digital
simulations as they often lead to slower learning, but they should be useful
in the future both to better understand biological neural systems, and to
implement new neural physical systems in silicon or other substrates.

ij represents the signal carried by the deep learning channel and
the postsynaptic term in the learning rules considered here. Diﬀerent al-
gorithms reveal the essential ingredients of this signal and how it can be
simpliﬁed. In the last row, the function F can be implemented with sparse
or adaptive matrices, carry low precision signals, or include non-linear trans-
formations in the learning channel (see also [4]).

In supervised learning, the critical equations show that in principle any
deep weights must depend on all the training examples and all the other
weights of the network. Backpropagation shows that it is possible to derive
eﬀective learning rules of the form Δwh

the postynaptic terms must: (1) implement gradient descent for the top layer
(i.e. random weights in the learning channel for the top layer do not work
F (T − O),
at all); (2) for any other deep layer h it should be of the form f
wheref
represents the derivatives of the activations of the units in layer h
(the derivatives above are not necessary) and F is some reasonable function
of the error T −O. By reasonable, we mean that the function F can be linear,
or a composition of linear propagation with non-linear activation functions,
it can be ﬁxed or slowly varying, and when matrices are involved these can
be random, sparse, etc. As can be expected, it is better if these matrices are
full rank although gracious degradation, as opposed to catastrophic failure,
is observed when these matrices deviate slightly from the full rank case.

(cid:2)

The robustness and other properties of these algorithms cry for expla-
nations and more general principles. We have provided both intuitive and
formal explanations for several of these properties. On the mathematical side,
polynomial learning rules in linear networks lead to systems of polynomial
diﬀerential equations. We have shown in several cases that the corresponding
ODEs converge to an optimal solution. However these polynomial systems
of ODEs rapidly become complex and, while the results provided are useful,
they are not yet complete, thus providing directions for future research.

Appendix: Proof of Theorem 10
Assume that (A, B) ∈ F. If near (A, B), F is not discrete, then there are
real analytic matrix-valued functions (A(t), B(t)) ∈ F for small t > 0 such
that (A(0), B(0)) = (A, B). Moreover, if we write:

E + ET + BEBBT + B(BEB)T = 0

(122)

Let:

X = EAT + BEB Y = E + BEBBT

(123)

Then by the above equations, both X, Y are skew symmetric, and we have
Y AT = X. If Y (cid:6)= 0, using an orthogonal transformation and scaling, we
may assume that:

A = aI for a real number a (cid:6)= 0. As a result, we have:

K = (

and (A, B) = (aI, a
obtained by orthogonal transformation from (A(t), B(t)). Since both K, L
are proportional to the identity, ( ˜A(t), ˜B(t)) ∈ F. Now let us write:

)I

(128)
Then the equation B + BT − AAT = K is equivalent to the following system:

˜A(t) =

⎫⎬

(129)

Since t is small, ˜A(t) should be suﬃciently close to aI. From the second
equation of the system above, we have ˜d = a. If ˜b = 0, then we conclude
from the ﬁrst equation of the same system that ˜a = a, and hence ˜A(t) = aI.
This implies that (A(t), B(t)) = (A, B). So in this case E = 0.
Things are more complicated when ˜b (cid:6)= 0. We ﬁrst assume that a (cid:6)=
−1.
In this case, from the third equation of the system above, we have
−1 + ˜d = 0. Since we already have ˜d = a (cid:6)= 1, for suﬃciently small t,
−1 ˜d
˜a
˜a = − ˜d
−2 = −a
−2, which is distinct from a. Thus in this case ˜b must be zero.
If a = −1, then we have ˜d = −1 and ˜a = −1. Using the ﬁrst equation of
the system above, we have ˜b = 0 and the again (A(t), B(t)) = ( ˜A(t), ˜B(t)) =
(A, B), and we conclude that E = 0.

From the results above, we know that if Y (cid:6)= 0 or if A is proportional to
the identity, near (A, B) ∈ F, there are no other elements in F and thus F
is discrete. When X = Y = 0, it is possible to have E (cid:6)= 0. However, we
have the following Lemma:
Lemma 3: If X = Y = 0, and if A (cid:6)= −I, then E is not an invertible matrix.

Proof. By contradiction, assume that E is invertible. Then from X = 0, we
have:

−A = EBBT E
By taking determinant on both sides, we get:

−1

det A = det(−A) = det(BBT )

Thus we have:

(130)

(131)

Since A is similar to a negative deﬁnite matrix −BBT , the eigenvalues λ1, λ2
of A are all negative. Since λ1λ2 = det A = 1, we have:

det A = 1

(132)

62

−λ1 − λ2 ≥ 2

Using the same matrix representation as in Equation (125), we have:

−a − d = −Tr A = Tr (BBT ) = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2

However:

(133)

(134)

a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = (a + d)2 + (b − c)2 − 2 ≥ (a + d)2 − 2 ≥ −a − d, (135)
and the equality is true if and only if b = c and a+d = −2. Since −λ1−λ2 = 2
and λ1λ2 = 1, the eigenvalues of A must be −1,−1, which implies b = c = 0.
Thus A = −I which is impossible by our assumption.

Next we consider the remaining case: X = Y = 0, and E is not invertible
(but not equal to zero), and A is not proportional to the identity. In this
case, we have to take up to third order derivatives to reach the conclusion.
By taking derivatives of the ﬁrst two relations in Equation (112), we get:

P + P T = Q + QT = R + RT = S + ST = 0

ABSTRACT
The Cytochrome C Oxidase 1 (COI) gene is among the
most popular markers for molecular biodiversity estimation.
In essence, COI-based approaches for taxonomic identiﬁca-
tion rely on comprehensive reference databases to assign
unknown sequences to known species and to enhance the
identiﬁcation of new species. As such, for COI-based meth-
ods to be eﬀective, the accuracy and integrity of reference
databases are critical. However, as COI repositories grow, it
becomes challenging to curate and validate user-contributed
data manually. This, in turn, propagates prediction errors,
leading to future erroneous taxonomic assignments. Here,
we propose a new computationally eﬃcient approach for
identifying anomalies which are either due to systematic bi-
ases (indels and chimeras) or to user error (mistranslation
and misclassiﬁcation). Our approach uses multiple sequence
alignments to model insertions, deletions, and substitutions
and ﬂag sequences with incongruous ﬁt to the model. Our
analysis of a complete set of curated Insecta COI reference
sequences identiﬁes the presence of numerous anomalous se-
quences, which makes a strong case for the validity of our
approach and for the importance of new strategies to screen
publicly available COI references.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Accurate species identiﬁcation is critical for estimating bio-
diversity and for better understanding the eﬀects of various
anthropogenic and natural disturbances on the underlying
biological landscape. For taxa that are well studied, visual
cataloging and identiﬁcation of morphological features by
an expert taxonomist is the gold standard for species iden-
tiﬁcation [2]. However, expert-led taxonomic identiﬁcation
is time-consuming and requires high sample integrity [10]

as well as intimate knowledge of phenotypic diﬀerences, in-
cluding those resulting from changes in life stages or gender.
These constraints render this approach inadequate in highly
biodiverse or complex environments from which organisms
cannot be extracted intact. Increasingly large biomonitoring
eﬀorts have resorted to molecular approaches where DNA-
based markers are brought to bear on evaluating species di-
versity [10]. The mitochondrial gene Cytochrome C Oxidase
I (COI) is a popular marker for the identiﬁcation of mem-
bers in the kingdom Animalia, due to its ease of sequencing
in most, if not all, animal phyla [10, 9]. Additionally, the
primary COI sequence, which consists of a 648-bp coding re-
gion, oﬀers greater range of phylogenetic signal, particularly
at the highly diverse third-position nucleotides, compared to
other markers such as 12S or 18S ribosomal markers [13].

High-throughput sequencing projects rely on similarity and
divergence patterns within and across taxonomic levels to
estimate the number and the nature of species in a sam-
ple [18]. For these estimations to be accurate, the as-
sembly of a comprehensive reference database is critical.
The set of available COI reference sequences is collated in
specialized archives such as the Barcode of Life Database
(BOLD: http://www.boldsystems.org), a library of bar-
codes for eukaryotic life [18]; and the Moorea BioCode
Project (http://mooreabiocode.org/), a comprehensive in-
ventory of all non-microbial life in a complex tropical ecosys-
tem. COI markers are also commonly submitted to public
sequence databases, such as the NCBI’s GenBank. While
the quality of the sequences deposited to public databases
is traditionally screened for trivial discrepancies – such as
the occurrence of a stop codon in the open reading frame
(ORF) — ultimate responsibility for quality and taxonomic
accuracy of the data lies with the project participants [18].
As such, as the number of COI sequences submitted to spe-
cialized databases increases, the likelihood of introducing er-
roneous references also increases in more than trivial ways.
For instance, library preparation and sequencing error rates
can exceed 4% in state-of-the-art protocols for amplicon se-
quencing [19]. As such, inaccuracies in reference databases
are inevitable.

In preliminary simulations on a subset of 1,000 sequences
downloaded from the BOLD database (data not included),
random insertions or deletions (indels) did not produce a
stop codon in more than 15% of the sequences. This shows
that relying solely on the detection of premature stops in
ORFs is not suﬃcient. In addition to indels, chimeras; or

APPLIED COMPUTING REVIEW  DEC. 2017,  VOL. 17,  NO. 46hybrid sequences from multiple parents, are a signiﬁcant
source of bias in specialized marker databases. Chimeric
sequences arise predominantly during the PCR ampliﬁca-
tion stage when an incomplete PCR fragment serves as a
primer by binding the template DNA of diﬀerent species [21].
According to Porazinska et al. [17], chimeras can account
for as much as 46% of the sequence data. Chimeras can
also arise, albeit to a lesser extent, from the fusion of un-
bound sequences [20]. Popular bioinformatics tools such as
uchime [4] or ChimaraSlayer [6] are often used for detect-
ing COI chimeras. These tools can achieve great sensitivity
when the chimera fragments originate from evolutionarily
distant sequences. However, due to their computationally
intensive nature, chimera detection tools are often omit-
ted from pipelines and replaced by cross-sample abundance
checks, under the assumption that sequences that only occur
in low-abundance in a single sample are erroneous. This ap-
proach perhaps partially explains why chimeras are still rou-
tinely identiﬁed in curated 16S databases despite the abun-
dance of tools for detecting them [15].

Exogenous contamination is yet another source of bias in
public databases. By exogenous contamination, we refer to
kingdom-level COI sequences mismatches, such as the recov-
ery of bacterial sequence in a project focused on animals. A
common practice for handling exogenous contamination is
by screening against known, exogenous references [18]. This
approach is ideal for ﬁltering out known contamination, but
cannot detect sequences not available in the contamination
database.

Given the crucial role that specialized reference databases
play in diversity estimation, rigorous inspection and detec-
tion of erroneous sequences they may contain is critical.
Indeed, systematic errors not only lead to the signiﬁcant
overestimation of diversity but can also bias measures of
intra- and inter-taxonomic level sequence similarity, which,
in turn, leads to future erroneous taxonomic assignments.

In this work, we present a COI sequence anomaly detec-
tion model which leverages the functional constraints on
a COI amino acid sequence to identify potentially anoma-
lous sequences that deviate signiﬁcantly from the proﬁle(s)
compiled at a given taxonomic level. We hypothesize that
given a large enough sample of correct sequences, anoma-
lous sequences will appear as statistical outliers. Our ap-
proach works in three distinct steps: 1- sequence ﬁltering
and dereplication, 2- score proﬁle inference and modeling
and 3- identiﬁcation of sequence anomalies. During the ﬁrst
step, we construct a taxonomic group’s multiple sequence
alignment from a preprocessed dataset. In the second step,
we compute the similarity for each sequence in the align-
ment against the remaining sequences, and use these values
in a non-parametric model to describe sequence variability
in each column of the multiple sequence alignment. In the
last step, we use the model to ﬂag sequences that exhibit
poor statistical ﬁt against the multiple sequence alignment.

By working at the amino acid level, we can detect arti-
facts are not challenging to identify using the nucleotide
sequences. Furthermore, by choosing to model amino acid
diﬀerences in each column of the multiple sequence align-
ment, we account for localized variability that results from
functional constraints speciﬁc to diﬀerent regions of the COI

protein [14].

Our results show that this approach is eﬀective for detect-
ing insertions, deletions, chimeras, mis-translations and con-
taminations in Insecta sequences from the BOLD database.
Furthermore, this method is computationally eﬃcient and
is a good addition to existing strategies for monitoring the
integrity of specialized databases.

2. METHODS
All the COI amino acid sequences annotated to the Insecta
class were downloaded from the BOLD database (Bold Sys-
tem v3. Dec 2015). These sequences were preprocessed and
analyzed as described below.

2.1 Sequence Filtering and Reference MSA

Generation

Sequences with more than 3% of ambiguous amino acids
(represented as X in the sequences) or shorter than 180
a.a. were discarded. The remaining sequences were clus-
tered with cd-hit [5] using 99.5% similarity threshold. Rep-
resentative sequences from each cluster were divided by or-
der and aligned using MAFFT’s fast approximate alignment
mode [11, 12]. Each MAFFT alignment was subsequently
parsed to identify seed sequences and partial replicates. The
seeds are references against which other sequences aligned
with no insertions and with at least 93% similarity, whereas
the partial replicates are the sequences that align against
the seeds with no insertions and with at least 93% similar-
ity. The seeds were subsequently aligned using MAFFT’s
sensitive mode, yielding what we refer to in what follows as
the reference MSA.

Figure 1: Sample multiple sequence alignment with

n = 6 and l = 12

2.2 Score Proﬁle Inference
Given a reference MSA of n sequences and l columns, we
compute the similarity score Sij of sequence i’s jth amino
acid (ij), where 0 < i < n and 0 < j < l as:

Sij =!20

d=1 δ(ij, d) × #of amino acids d at position j

n

where δ is a function for scoring a pair of amino acids based
the BLOSUM80 substitution matrix.

The score Sij represents the overall similarity of sequence
i’s jth amino acid, to the remaining amino acids observed in
that column [3]. For example, in Figure 1, the score Sij for
sequence 6 at column 12 (highlighted in red in the ﬁgure)
is: Sij = 3/6 · δ(M, M ) + 2/6 · δ(M, I) + 1/6 · δ(M, G) =
2/6 · 6 + 2/6 · 1 + 1/6 ·− 4 = 1.66.

APPLIED COMPUTING REVIEW  DEC. 2017,  VOL. 17,  NO. 47To account for simialrity biases such as when the amino
acid at position j in sequence i is rare or comes from an
undersampled species in the dataset, we smooth, Si,j using
a moving average approach with a window of size m [22].
Thus, for a sequence i, the smoothed score SSik at position
j is computed as:

SSik =!k+m/2

j=k−m/2 Sij for k < (l − m/2)

We refer in what follows to the set of smoothed scores for
sequence i, SSi∗ = [SSi1, SSi2, . . . , SSil] as the score proﬁle
(See Figure 2A).

2.3 Score Proﬁles and Sequence Anomalies
At each column k of the reference MSA, we model the dis-
tribution of score proﬁles SS∗,k (SS1,k, SS2,k, ...) using a
univariate Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with a Gaus-
sian Kernel [16]. KDE is a non-parametric method for esti-
mating the probability density function of a random variable
from a set of observations. Conceptually, a KDE is similar
to a histogram. However, instead of discretizing the data, a
KDE is smooth and continuous.
We chose to model SS∗,k using a non-parametric KDE since
this approach does not make any assumptions about the
structure of underlying distributions of scores at each col-
umn. This makes the method particularly resilient to multi-
modal distributions of scores which could arise due to taxo-
nomic subclustering of the sequences. This consideration is
essential when working at higher taxonomic levels, particu-
larly in old lineages, where sequence diversiﬁcation is poten-
tially non-negligible and where sequences are most likely to
cluster tightly according to the underlying taxonomic levels.
For example, due to the considerable phylogenetic distance
between the Mecoptera and Diplura orders of the Insecta
class is likely to translate for some columns as a multimodal
distribution of the smoothed similarity scores.

Using a column’s KDE, we can quickly estimate the proba-
bility of observing an SS value at a particular column. Fig-
ure 2 (Bottom) gives an example of two KDEs ﬁtted using
the scores observed at columns k = 330 and k = 350 respec-
tively. The distribution at column 330 shows less variance
than that at 350, which reﬂects the distribution of scores
seen over both columns. The probability density of the red
curve quantiﬁes our conﬁdence in the quality of the align-
ment of the red sequences over that at 350.

Given that we model the scores independently at each col-
umn, the resulting KDEs capture the diﬀerences in amino-
acid diversiﬁcation rates across functionally distinct sites in
the COI protein.

For each sequence, we were interested in identifying sub-
sequences exhibiting poor ﬁt against the reference MSA.
This amounts to ﬁnding SS values with low probability, as
computed by KDE distributions of proﬁle scores. The oc-
currence of a single low-probability position is not per se
indicative of an anomalous mutation.
In an MSA with a
large number of sequences, a mutation in a highly conserved
amino-acid, such as in Tryptophan (W) is assinged a low
probability density. However, the occurrence of multiple,
consecutive low-probability density positions is unlikely to
occur in a normal sequence. To identify the longest stretches

of low-probability density windows in each sequence, we used
Kadane’s algorithm, as described in [1]. Given a sequence of
positive and negative values, Kadane’s algorithm ﬁnds the
continuous subsequence that maximizes the sum of its el-
ements, i.e., no other subsequence can add up to a larger
value. Given that Kadane’s algorithm requires positive and
negative values as input, we mapped our probability densi-
ties into scores using the following equations:

σ(l, e, k) = k(√x − √e)

p, such that values of p where (p ≤ ϵ) are converted into

decreasing negative values, while the probability densities
describing a good-ﬁt (p >ϵ ) are converted into increasing
positive values (Figure 3). Here we choose ϵ as 0.03. For
example, the probability densities 0.001, 0.05, 0.4 and 0.9
are converted using Equation 1 into the values -141, 50, 459,
775. We refer to the continuous subsequence that maximizes
the sum of σ-converted probability densities as Minimum
Scoring Segment (MSS). A MSS value represents the size of
the stretch where the ﬁt between a sequence and a reference
MSA is minimal according to the distributions of SS scores,
i.e., the alignment is of poor quality.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The dataset downloaded from the BOLD database consisted
of 515,133 sequences from the class Insecta, spread across
16 taxonomic orders (See Table 1 for a breakdown of the
number of sequences per order).

Due to the high similarity among COI sequences at
the amino-acid level, the clustering- and alignment-based
dereplication steps allowed us to reduce the dataset by over
1,000-fold, and resulted in 5,729 seed sequences (See Ta-
ble 1). The seeds were aligned into a reference MSA us-
ing MAFFT’s sensitive mode. The reference MSA consisted
of 1057 columns and was, overall, of poor quality; 79% of
the columns in the reference MSA contained gaps in 5,000
or more sequences. The number of gaps varied abruptly
throughout the alignment and was notably higher at both
ends of the MSA, suggesting that gaps were introduced in
bulk. Through visual inspection of the alignment, we ob-
served that the majority of the gaps were indeed inserted
due to a few sequences which contained rare or unique re-
gions.

The resulting reference alignment would most likely be dif-
ferent if it included the partial replicate sequences. However,
we conjecture that since the partial replicates do not contain
insertions, their addition would have introduced minor, con-
ﬁned substitutions, which would not impact our approach,
particularly since we average the score proﬁles across a slid-
ing window.

The SS scores and their probability densities were computed
for all sequences using a window size m = 11. This step took
less than two minutes to complete on a laptop with 16GB
of RAM and 2.8 GHz CPU.

Under the na¨ıve assumption that the observed probability
densities at consecutive positions of a sequence are inde-
pendent, various approaches can be used to decide whether
sequence i is anomalous. For example, one can set either a
minimum threshold on the lowest allowed probability den-
sity in a sequence, or a maximum allowable number of con-
secutive low-probability densities above which we deem a
sequence anomalous. Our approach consists of identifying
in each sequence the longest stretch with the lowest prob-
ability densities – this is analogous to ﬁnding the longest
substring with the weakest ﬁt against the reference MSA.
To achieve this, we convert the probability density in each
position into a positive or negative score in a manner that
is proportional to its probability densities, i.e., increasingly
large probability densities are assigned increasingly large,
positive scores and increasingly small probability densities
are assigned increasingly large, negative scores. We then use
the scores as input to Kadane’s algorithm.

In essence, any monotonically increasing function that as-
signs increasingly positive scores to increasingly probably
events and increasingly small negative values to increasingly
unlikely events is a potential candidate for converting prob-
ability densities to scores. A simple and intuitive example
is a linear function with a positive slope which crosses the
x − axis at a given threshold ϵ (ex. y = 400x − 20 crosses
x at ϵ = 0.05). However, a linear function cannot increase
suﬃciently fast to assign a large range of values to the low-
conﬁdence interval [0,ϵ] without assigning extreme values to
the high-conﬁdence interval where x > ϵ. By contrast, the
function described in Equation 1 can allow suﬃcient con-
trol over the range of values assigned to the low- and high-
conﬁdence intervals.

We used the converted probability densities to compute the
MSS values for each sequence in reference MSA. A total of
1,622 sequences had an MSS value of at least 1. The largest
MSS value was 196 and the smallest MMS value was 0. An
MSS value of 0 indicates an overall good quality ﬁt to the
reference MSA and, overall, no poorly aligned regions. On
the other hand, an MSS value of 196 indicates a low-quality
alignment against the reference MSA over a window of at
least 196 amino acids. Except for trivial cases, conﬁrming
whether a sequence is anomalous requires manual review
and supporting evidence. As such, the MSS value should be
viewed as an indicator of the length of the misaligned region,
rather than an absolute predictor of whether a sequence is
anomalous. For our reference MSA, gap-free substrings are,
on average, 11 amino acids long. As such, we use an MSS
value of 25, which arises most frequently in out data from
the misalignment of a subsequence of length 19-13 amino
acids, using a window of size m = 11.

Investigation of Anomalous Sequences

3.1
A total of 170 seeds contained MSS values greater than or
equal to 25. These sequences served as seeds for 2,062 partial
replicates, with four seeds (GBLN4189-14, GBMIN13163-

values below 25, the mean MSS was 3.69 with a standard
deviation of 5.

We randomly selected and manually inspected a subset of 70
sequences with an MSS higher than 25. A sequence was con-
ﬁrmed as anomalous if we could classify it unequivocally into
one of following four error classes: 1- mistranslated amino
acid sequence, 2- containing an insertion or a deletion (in-
del), 3- chimera, or 4- misclassiﬁcation. We considered a
sequence suspicious if its MSS aligned with low-quality to
the reference MSA, but its assignment to any of the four
error classes was not evident.

3.1.1 Mistranslated Sequences
The MSS values and the score proﬁle curves are intuitive
representations of anomalies. For instance, mistranslated
sequences are trivial to identify visually using score proﬁle
curves; their score proﬁle is consistently low, and their MSS
value is close to their sequence length. These sequences are
also trivial to validate, as they have an alternative, full ORF
which produces a better overall alignment and substantially
reduces the MSS value. One such sequence, CNKOC293-14,
has a consistently negative proﬁle score using the submitted
translation (See Figure 4). When using the ﬁrst ORF on
the reverse strand, the same sequence yields a consistently
positive score.

Indel Containing Sequences

3.1.2
The score proﬁle curve of an indel-containing sequence is
diﬀerent. The DNA sequences pre- and post-indel either
produce well or poorly aligned regions. The subsequence
that aligns well has a higher proﬁle score, which leads to a
notable change in the score proﬁle curve either from high to
low or the inverse. In sequences with indels, the MSS length
is a function of the location of the indel in the sequence. In-
dels represent the most abundant anomalies in our dataset.
Sequence LEPIN057-14 is a good example as it shows an
evident change in the sequence’s score proﬁle near k = 220
(See Figure 4). Translation of this sequence into all reading
frames shows that the second ORF produces a better ﬁt for
the ﬁrst 220 amino acids of the reference MSA, whereas the
ﬁrst ORF results in a better ﬁt for amino acids located after
position 220 in the reference MSA. An early occurrence of
an indel can yield a predominantly non-homologous amino-
acid sequence with a large MSS and results in a score proﬁle
that is most similar to that of a mistranslated sequence.

3.1.3 Out of Class Contamination
Pipelines used for analyzing COI data, such as the one pro-
posed in [18] and utilized in BOLD, suggest screening the
COI sequences against a custom-compiled contamination
database. This approach does not work when the sources
of contamination are not cataloged. For instance, despite
the screening carried out by BOLD on a small suite of pos-
sible contaminants, we were able to identify sequences with
substantially divergent proﬁle scores. For instance, sequence
MANT163-13, was submitted to the BOLD database as orig-
inating from a Hymenoptera but showed a score proﬁle curve
that was consistently lower than the median score proﬁle.
This sequence of 217 amino acids has an MSS value of 196,

suggesting a poor alignment over the complete sequence (See
Figure 4). A Blast search of this sequence against the NR
database (using the NCBI’s web BLASTP with default pa-
rameters) showed that most returned hits were of proteobac-
terial origin. More speciﬁcally, 49 of the top 50 BLAST
hits were against Legionellaceae bacteria, with the best hit
aligning with 98% similarity over the complete length of
the sequence. Further investigation showed that Legionella
can reside within insect hemocytes and that some insects
are commonly used as models for studying the immune re-
sponse to Legionella infections [7, 8]. Under the light of
such evidence, we hypothesized that this sequence is in fact
from a Legionellaceae pathogen, rather than from the Hy-
menoptera host. Other sequences were also predicted using
BLASTP to be of bacterial origin. For instance, the top 50
best hits of sequence CNEIE680-12 (MSS= 59) were against
bacterial sequences in the Oxalobacteraceae family. For se-
quence SSWLE10476-13 (MSS = 47) which also shows a
consistently low score proﬁle that matched closely with that
of MANT163-13, the three most signiﬁcant Blast hits are
to arthropods, two annotated at the class level (Insecta)
and one annotated at the family level (Staphylinidae). The
fourth hit, however, was against a bacterium Rickettsiella
grylli. Interestingly, while we couldn’t initially neither con-
ﬁrm nor deny that this sequence represents bacterial con-
tamination, a comment posted by a BOLD database curator
in November 2015 identiﬁed this sequence as contamination.
As such, we hypothesize that this sequence’s top Arthro-
poda hits are likely artifacts resulting from the propagation
of erroneous annotation. These examples of contamination
highlight the limitations in using a reference database for
contaminant screening.

Indel containing sequences or chimeras are challenging to
detect using alignment at the nucleotide level in the absence
of references that are similar to it. However, the previous
examples clearly illustrate that a switch in a score proﬁle can
be a reasonable tell-tale of a sequence anomaly, regardless of
whether or not similar references are present in the database.

3.2

Identifying Anomalies in Out of Sample
Data

We evaluated the performance of our method on out of sam-
ple sequences for which the status (anomalous vs. non-
anomalous) is known. First, we generated two datasets from
the sequences which we excluded from the reference MSA.

The ﬁrst dataset consisted of 100 randomly picked partial
replicate sequence with a seed containing an MSS value less
than 15, i.e., those are random sequences we believe are not
anomalous. The second dataset consists of 50 randomly se-
lected partial replicate sequences which aligned with a seed
among the 70 we manually conﬁrmed as anomalous. Se-
quences from both datasets were incorporated into the ref-
erence MSA using transitive alignments. Speciﬁcally, given
a pairwise alignment of the partial replicate a and its seed
b, and given a reference MSA describing the alignment of
the seeds b and c, we can transitively align a and c by intro-
ducing gaps in a so that its alignment in the reference MSA
matches its ﬁrst alignment on b except where both a and
b have gaps (See Figure 5 for an example). This transitive
operation is unambiguous given that a’s alignment against

b does not include any gaps.

replicate, a, against the seed c. 1) The Initial

alignment used to dereplicate a and keep b as a

reference MSA. 3) In addition to the original gaps

introduced in a during the initial alignment (1),

gaps from b’s alignment with c are also transitively
added to a. The transitive gaps are shown in red

For the ﬁrst dataset, out the 100 sequences inspected, a sin-
gle sequence (ASWAX567-08) had a MSS value above 15
(MSS value of 33). This suggested that this partial replicate
was anomalous despite the fact that its seed (BBHEC816-
10) had a MSS of 0. Upon manual inspection, we identiﬁed
an insertion of an adenosine base at position 628, the re-
moval of which produced a MSS of 0. This conﬁrmed that
sequenceASWAX567-08 was indeed anomalous.

For the second dataset, only 26 of the 50 sequences randomly
generated from anomalous seeds had MSS values above 25.
All the partial replicates with MSS values greater than 25
had the same irregular patterns observed in their seeds.

However, the 21 remaining sequences had MSS values be-
tween 1 and 23, with an average MSS value of 5.1. After
manually inspecting these sequences, we observed that these
MSS-scoring sequences were shorter than their seeds and, in
most cases, did not or did only partially cover the regions in
their seeds where we observed the irregular patterns.

The outcomes form both out of sample datasets above show
that partial replicates can have a diﬀerent classiﬁcation from
that of their assigned seed. Therefore, one cannot screen
dereplicated datasets and propagate the status of seeds onto
the partial replicates they substitute. This applies whether
or not we can conﬁrm the seeds as anomalous. However,
although our analyses did not extend to partial replicates –
beyond the out of sample tests above – the computational
tractability of our method facilitates the subsequent incor-
poration of partial replicates into the reference MSA and
provides an eﬃcient approach to screen additional sequences
at a linear computation cost.

Impact of the Window Size on the Identi-
ﬁcation of Anomaly Boundaries

The window size, m, plays a critical role in identifying the
boundaries of an artifact causing a region of low-quality
alignment in a sequence – particularly in the presence of
large, conserved gaps. In essence, smaller values of m are
ideal for identifying short regions that do not align well
with the reference MSA, whereas larger values of m can
smooth out short anomalies. For example, using m = 2,
the m-smoothed scores for S = [5.5, 1.0,−2.1, 5.9, 5.5,−2.5]

APPLIED COMPUTING REVIEW  DEC. 2017,  VOL. 17,  NO. 411are SS = [nan, 3.2,−0.5, 1.9, 5.7, 1.4], whereas the smoothed
scores with m = 3 are SS = [nan, nan, 2.5, 2.5, 1.6, 2.2] (nan
are assigned to position where the SS score cannot be com-
puted to window constraints). As the windows size grows,
the inﬂuence of distant, highly similar positions – including
the gaps-rich columns introduced to compensate for rare ar-
tifacts – soften the contribution of misaligned columns and
either shrink resulting MSS values or lead to completely
missing the poorly aligned region. However, the inﬂuence
of distant columns is desirable for merging windows of low
conservation, when those are interspersed with gap rich col-
umn. Figure 6 illustrates this issue for a subsequence of
the mistranslated seed (CNKOC293-14). Although this se-
quence has little similarity with the remaining seeds, the
gap-rich columns of the reference MSA cause a signiﬁcant
upshift in the score proﬁle curve. With a short window (ex.
m = 5), the two island of spurious similarity can interrupt
the MMS extension, and therefore underestimate the extent
of the anomaly.

Figure 6: Alignment of mistranslated sequence
along gaps-rich columns. Despite low similarity

with the remaining seeds, the sequence shows score

proﬁle over the gap-rich columns

In the absence of a consistent window size for detecting
anomalies, a reasonable strategy consists of employing a
large window size to weed out conspicuous anomalies and
to decrease the window size gradually to capture shorter
anomalies. For instance, by using a window k=15, we were
able to identify 45 sequences with MSS values higher than
100. The removal of these sequences leads to more compact
alignments (number of columns only 67% columns in the
reference MSA contained gaps in 5,000 or more sequences
compared to 79% before). Furthermore, removing 45 se-
quences identiﬁed with m = 15 leads to an increase in the
observed MSS when reanalyzing the data using m = 11

4. CONCLUSION
The COI marker has proved eﬀective for metabarcoding
projects and its use has made signiﬁcant contributions in
the ﬁeld of ecology. Thus far, the process of cataloging new
species in reference libraries has mostly relied on the use
of targeted sequencing. This low-throughput activity has
served the data curation process by keeping a handle on
the number of errors in the COI reference databases. How-
ever, targeted sequencing is painstakingly slow and cannot
be used to ﬁll the large gap in sequence diversity. Thus, as
researchers turn to high-throughput methods for cataloging
diversity – notably for sequencing environmental DNA or
bulk biodiversity samples –, automatic methods for scaling

the validation of submitted COI sequences will become crit-
ical.

Here we propose a new approach that leverages the coding
nature of the COI marker to probabilistically identify experi-
mental errors that are challenging to detect at the nucleotide
level. Our tests were able to identify numerous sequence
anomalies in the well-curated BOLD database. Our results
highlight the usefulness of this approach, both due to its
computational tractability and it intuitive interpretability,
and make a strong case for its use as a complement to exist-
ing tools to identify anomalous sequences in COI reference
databases.

ABSTRACT
We study the relationship between memory accesses, bank
conflicts, thread multiplicity (also known as over-subscription)
and instruction-level parallelism in comparison-based sort-
ing algorithms for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We
experimentally validate a proposed formula that relates these
parameters with asymptotic analysis of the number of mem-
ory accesses by an algorithm. Using this formula we analyze
and compare several GPU sorting algorithms, identifying
key performance bottlenecks in each one of them. Based on
this analysis we propose a GPU-efficient multiway merge-
sort algorithm, GPU-MMS, which minimizes or eliminates
these bottlenecks and balances various limiting factors for
specific hardware.

We realize an implementation of GPU-MMS and compare
it to sorting algorithm implementations in state-of-the-art
GPU libraries on three GPU architectures. Despite these
library implementations being highly optimized, we find
that GPU-MMS outperforms them by an average of 21% for
random integer inputs and 14% for random key-value pairs.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sorting is a primitive operation that is a building block
for countless algorithms. It is therefore important to de-
sign and implement sorting algorithms that approach peak
performance on a range of hardware architectures. Graph-
ics Processing Units (GPUs) are particularly attractive ar-
chitectures as they provide massive parallelism and com-
puting power. However, designing and implementing algo-
rithms that achieve peak performance on GPUs is a chal-
lenging task. Many factors can stifle GPU performance, in-
cluding: sub-optimal memory access patterns, insufficient
parallelism, overuse of scarce resources (e.g., shared mem-
ory), low instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and thread branch
divergence. Many prior works have considered these factors
individually and provided models and optimizations in an
attempt to achieve peak GPU performance [1, 11, 16, 24, 25,
31, 41]. However, there is frequently a complex tradeoff be-
tween these performance factors and it is not clear which
of them affect overall performance the most. For example, it
is well-known that a large multiplicity 1 (number of threads
scheduled per core) is required to hide memory latency. But
excessive use of shared memory to avoid slow global mem-
ory accesses may reduce the number of threads scheduled
per core due to lack of shared memory resources. As a result
of these complex tradeoffs, developers frequently rely on
heuristics and trial-and-error to achieve high performance

on GPUs. Instead, we propose an analytical approach to
identify these tradeoffs, aiding in the development of new,
GPU-efficient algorithms.

Memory hierarchy utilization. The three levels of mem-
ory hierarchy on GPUs (global memory, shared memory, reg-
isters)2 provide various access latencies and bandwidths. All
else being equal, using a faster memory type will obviously
result in a faster implementation. However, often the utiliza-
tion of faster memory results in more complex algorithms
and the tradeoff between different approaches is not as clear.
For example, Leischner et al. [23] present a randomized GPU
samplesort algorithm, which implements multiway quicksort.
Extensive research on I/O-efficient algorithms predicts that
such multiway sorting algorithms should fully utilize fast
shared memory and reduce accesses to slow global memory.
Despite these types of I/O-efficient algorithms performing
well on CPUs, on the GPU the MGPU library implementa-
tion of simple two-way mergesort [3] is much faster than
the multiway samplesort of Leischner et al. [23].
Bank conflict free algorithms. One of the arguments
why samplesort of Leischner et al. [23] is not the fastest in
practice could be attributed to large number of bank con-
flicts in shared memory. Therefore, Koike and Sadakane [21]
developed a bank conflict free multi-way mergesort algo-
rithm. Unfortunately, we could not obtain the source code of
their implementation to compare it to MGPU experimentally.
However, analysis of their results indicates that, despite su-
perior utilization of shared memory and bank conflict avoid-
ance, their multiway mergesort would still be slower than
MGPU’s two-way mergesort implementation.
Thread occupancy, multiplicity and ILP. Using I/O
complexity analysis of the External Memory model [2], it
can be shown that the multiway mergesort of Koike and
Sadakane [21] achieves asymptotically optimal global mem-
ory accesses, while MGPU mergesort does not. However, the
I/O complexity analysis ignores many other performance fac-
tors that are significant for GPUs. In Section 4.2 we determine
that the data structures used by Koike and Sadakane require
a large amount of shared memory, limiting occupancy and
significantly reducing overall performance. This illustrates
the importance of parallelism when designing GPU-efficient
algorithms. In Section 3, we investigate the impact of paral-
lelism on GPU performance, showing that both multiplicity
and ILP are important GPU performance factors.
1.1 Our Contributions
In this paper, we present an analytical framework that we use
to study a range of factors that impact the performance of
GPU-efficient comparison-based sorting algorithms. In par-
ticular, we consider the relationship between multiplicity X,
instruction-level parallelism I, bandwidth B, and latency L
2Modern GPUs contain other types of memory that we do not consider
here. Caches are implemented in the shared and global memories that we do
discuss, while texture and constant memories are more useful for graphics
rendering than general purpose computations.

In this paper, we focus on the analysis and design of
comparison-based sorting algorithms for GPUs. A natural
question arises: why bother with comparison-based sorting
algorithms? After all, all numbers on modern computers are
stored in binary representation and one can map these repre-
sentations to integers and use an integer sorting algorithm,
such as radix sort, which is known to be faster in practice. To
answer this question, consider the following problem, which
is a natural problem in computational geometry: given a set
of line segments defined by endpoints with integer coordi-
nates, order them by their slopes. Storing the slopes as fixed
precision floating point numbers can lead to rounding errors
and, consequently, to erroneous result [4]. Instead, the slopes
can be stored without any loss in precision as fractions, each
represented by two integers: a numerator and a denominator.
Then, the relative order of two fractions a
d can easily
be determined without any loss in precision by comparing
ad to bc. Observe that to use radix sort to sort these frac-
tions, one would need to convert them into fractions with a
common denominator, which can require up to O(n) bits.

b and c

Comparison-based sorting is a thoroughly studied prob-
lem, with many implementations on GPUs, including the
highly optimized MGPU [3] and Thrust [15] library imple-
mentations. Yet, even for such a comprehensively studied
problem, the effects of the above factors and tradeoffs be-
tween them is not well-understood. Thus, we discuss these
factors to better understand how to balance them when de-
veloping GPU-efficient sorting algorithms. We assume the
reader is familiar with the aspects and terminology of the
GPU architectures, including thread organization, memory
hierarchy design and ideal data access patterns [33].

Bank conflicts. It is well-known [1, 21, 33] that when uti-
lizing shared memory, an algorithm must be careful to avoid
bank conflicts, as they negatively impact performance. Yet,
sometimes completely eliminating bank conflicts requires
an algorithm with higher complexity, and the increase in
the number of operations can offsets the benefit of remov-
ing bank conflicts. Instead, practitioners use heuristics to
reduce the number of bank conflicts by changing access pat-
terns without drastically changing the algorithm. This rarely
eliminates bank conflicts completely, and we show in Sec-
tion 3.3 that even a small average number of conflicts due
to randomly generated inputs can significantly impact per-
formance. Furthermore, one can find inputs that undermine
these heuristics and cause a large number of bank conflicts.
In Section 6.2 we show that, without too much effort, we can
generate conflict-heavy inputs that cause a state-of-the-art
sorting library implementation to execute up to 20% slower
due to bank conflicts.

of global memory, shared memory, and registers on NVIDIA
GPUs. We experimentally verify the accuracy of our frame-
work and show a simple mathematical relationship between
these parameters and how their tradeoffs affect algorithm
execution times. For example, we show that on our hard-
ware, multiplicity X and ILP I are fully interchangeable via
a simple relationship: I · X ≥ 8.

We consider two state-of-the-art GPU-efficient sorting al-
gorithms: modernGPU (MGPU) [3] pairwise mergesort and
the multiway mergesort presented by Koike and Sadakane [21].
For each algorithm, we analytically identify performance bot-
tlenecks. We then present GPU-MMS, a multiway mergesort
algorithm that mitigates or avoids these bottlenecks. MGPU
suffers from a sub-optimal number of global memory ac-
cesses, which we experimentally determine to account for
up to 75% of overall runtime. GPU-MMS avoids this, achiev-
ing an asymptotically optimal number of global memory
accesses at the cost of additional computation.3 As a result,
GPU-MMS achieves a balance between time spent computing
and time spent accessing memory. We find that the primary
bottleneck of Koike and Sadakane’s multiway mergesort is a
lack of sufficient parallelism. GPU-MMS mitigates this issue
by increasing both multiplicity and ILP. We show empiri-
cally that GPU-MMS outperforms the fastest currently avail-
able comparison-based sorting algorithms by up to 32.7%
on random integer inputs and 67.2% on worst-case input
permutations of integers.

Outline. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 describes our micro-
benchmarks. Section 4 presents our analysis of the existing
state-of-the-art sorting algorithms, and Section 5 details our
design and implementation of GPU-MMS. Section 6 presents
experimental results. Finally, Section 7 concludes with a
discussion of the significance of our results.
2 RELATED WORK
Over the past decade, a lot of research has focused on design-
ing efficient algorithms to solve a range of classical problems
on GPUs [9, 12, 17, 27, 36, 37, 39]. These works have intro-
duced several optimization techniques, such as coalesced
memory accesses [10, 11, 35], branch divergence elimina-
tion [19, 23], and bank conflict avoidance [1, 6, 9, 19]. Several
empirical models for specific GPUs have been proposed that
use micro-benchmarking [5, 41], and several fast GPU algo-
rithms have been produced [10, 17, 39] via the use of bench-
marks [40] and application of hardware-specific optimization
techniques to existing algorithms. Several authors proposed
abstract GPU performance models, attempting to capture

efficient remains a difficult open problem.

salient features of the GPU architectures in a way that at-
tempts to balance accuracy and simplicity [16, 22, 25, 30, 31].
Despite these efforts, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
work analyzed the tradeoff relationship between all of the
above performance parameters that we study here.

Sorting has been extensively studied over the past half-
century, and here we only mention previous work that fo-
cuses on the GPUs [3, 8, 12, 23, 26, 29, 38]. According to a re-
cent survey of several GPU libraries [29] the fastest currently-
available sorting implementations include the CUB [26], mod-
ernGPU (MGPU) [3], and Thrust [15] libraries. CUB employs
a GPU-optimized radix sort, which sorts based on the binary
representation of elements. MGPU and Thrust use variations
of mergesort (based on Green et al. [12]) While highly opti-
mized, these mergesort implementations issue sub-optimal
numbers of global memory accesses and incur shared mem-
ory bank conflicts. Leischner et al. [23] introduced GPU sam-
plesort, discussed in Section 1. Their work was continued by
Dehne et al. [8] with a deterministic version of the samplesort
algorithm. The work of Afshani and Sitchinava [1] focuses
on shared memory only and presents an algorithm that sorts
small inputs in shared memory without bank conflicts. Koike
and Sadakane [21] also present a GPU sorting algorithm
that minimizes global memory accesses using a multiway
mergesort that is also bank conflict-free (we analyze their
algorithm Section 4.2).
3 GPU PERFORMANCE FACTORS
In this section, we use a series of micro-benchmarks to de-
termine the performance profile of each level of the memory
hierarchy (including registers). We use the results to analyze
several sorting algorithms (Sections 4 and 5).
3.1 Experimental Methodology
We perform all experiments using three hardware platforms.
All computations are performed on the graphics cards, and
no attempt is made to use CPU compute resources. Execu-
tion times are measured as time spent computing on the
GPU, while time to transfer data between the CPU and GPU
is not included, as is customary in these types of experi-
ments [12, 23]. Table 1 presents the hardware specifications
of our three platforms, as well as the parameters derived via
micro-benchmarks. On all platforms we use GCC 4.8.1 and
CUDA 7.5, and all programs are compiled with the -O3 op-
timization flag. Performance metrics such as bank conflicts
are obtained via the nvprof profiling tool [32], included in
the CUDA 7.5 toolkit. Since running nvprof impacts perfor-
mance, execution times are measured on separate runs using
the cudaEvent timer. Unless otherwise noted, Each experi-
ment is repeated ten times, and we report the mean values,
showing min-max error bars when non-negligible.

3.2 Parallelism and Memory Performance
As discussed in Section 1, GPUs rely on multiplicity and
instruction-level parallelism (ILP) to hide memory latencies
and improve throughput. Formally, we say that the multi-
plicity X of an implementation is the number of threads
running per physical core (i.e., with P cores, we have a total
of X · P threads), while the ILP, I, is the average number of
consecutive independent instructions. The practical impact
of both multiplicity and ILP is to hide the latency of each
memory access. For instance, if we consider a single core
accessing a particular memory system A times, where each
access has latency L, the runtime would be A · L
X·I . We
define the latencies, Lд, Ls, and Lr as the number of clock
cycles required to access global memory, shared memory,
and registers, respectively. By increasing multiplicity and/or
ILP, we can decrease the time needed to perform these ac-
cesses until peak bandwidth is reached for the particular
memory system. We denote the peak bandwidth of global
memory, shared memory, and registers as Bд, Bs, and Br ,
respectively. We normalize bandwidth values to be the peak
number of elements accessed per clock cycle, per core. Thus,
with P processor cores, we estimate the total time to perform
AP parallel accesses to a memory system with latency L
and bandwidth B to be:

(cid:18) 1

(cid:24) L

(cid:25)(cid:19)

T ≈ AP · max

B ,

X · I

.

To verify the above performance estimate, we perform a
series of micro-benchmarks that measure the average time
to access each type of memory while varying multiplicity
(X) and ILP (I), on each of our platforms.

We measure the impact of multiplicity and ILP on global
memory performance with a micro-benchmark that performs

from one global memory array into another, for several ILP
(I) values. When X = 1 and I = 1, the average time per
memory access, in clocks, is simply the latency, Lд, and for
larger amounts of ILP (I), each access takes less time (i.e.,
LдI ). As X grows, however, the total number of accesses
grows as well, so constant execution time indicates reduced
average time per access (i.e., LдX ). Once X · I becomes large
enough (∼ 8 in Figure 1), the time spent per access becomes
constant. At this point, increasing I has no impact and in-
creasing X increases execution time linearly, since the num-
ber of accesses increases with X. This corresponds to the

point where 1Bд

The latency and peak bandwidth for shared memory (Ls

Table 1 gives L and B values obtained for the three levels
of memory hierarchy on our three hardware platforms.
3.3 Bank Conflicts
As discussed in Section 1, shared memory must be accessed
in a specific pattern to avoid bank conflicts. To illustrate the
practical significance of bank conflicts, we consider the state-
of-the-art MGPU mergesort [3] algorithm (for details see

available for NVIDIA GPUs. The sorting implementation
included with MGPU is based on pairwise mergesort [7]
with a high degree of parallelism to run efficiently on GPUs.
MGPU algorithm overview – The latest MGPU (ver-
sion 2.10) mergesort takes an unsorted input of N elements
and performs a series of merge rounds to generate a sorted
output. MGPU assigns a fixed number E of elements to
each thread, where E depends on the GPU hardware (either
E = 11 or E = 15). Threads are grouped into thread-blocks of
t = 128 threads each. The algorithm begins by having each
thread sort E elements independently. Each thread-block
then merges t lists in shared memory to obtain a sorted list
of tE elements (we call this the base case). Pairs of lists are
then merged in subsequent rounds, with increasing num-
bers of threads performing each merge. During each merge
round, lists are partitioned using the Mergepath [13] method
in both global and shared memory.

Execution Time Estimate – We omit the details of our
analysis of the MGPU mergesort algorithm due to lack of
space. For full details, we refer interested readers to Karsin’s
dissertation [18] that includes a thorough analysis of MGPU.
Combining this analysis with the benchmark results from
Section 3, we estimate the runtime of MGPU mergesort as:

where Tд and Ts denotes the global and shared memory
access times, respectively.

We determine β1 = 3.1 and β2 = 2.2 by using the nvprof
tool [33] to empirically measure average numbers of bank
conflicts. These are simply estimates obtained with random
inputs and certain permutations may result in more or fewer
bank conflicts. We investigate this further in Section 6.2 by
generating inputs that result in many bank conflicts.
Since MGPU mergesort uses few registers, multiplicity
X is limited only by shared memory usage. Each thread
stores E elements in shared memory, and the GPU has a total
shared memory of size M, thus X = M
P E . ILP (I) depends
on optimizations and varies for each phase. MGPU employs
global memory access optimizations proposed by Merrill and
Grimshaw [27] that effectively doubles I. Shared memory
accesses are dependent, though additional accesses due to
bank conflicts are automatically issued independently [33],
so I = β1 or I = β2, depending on the kernel.
Combining the above analysis with the hardware parame-
ters listed in Table 1, we predict the execution time of MGPU

Figure 2 MGPU runtime and number of bank conflicts
vs. input sortedness for N = 108. Global memory trans-
actions are shown to illustrate that they are largely in-
dependent of input sortedness.

Section 4.1). Although MGPU mergesort uses a heuristic to
reduce bank conflicts, its shared memory access pattern is
data-dependent, so the number of bank conflicts is a function
of the input. Figure 2 illustrates a strong correlation between
the number of bank conflicts and overall runtime of MGPU
mergesort. Results show that, on Uhhpc, as we increase the
level of unsortedness, i.e., the number of inversions, the num-
ber of bank conflicts (measured using an execution profiler)
increases along with the overall execution time.

While we can measure bank conflicts and see that they im-
pact GPU performance, theoretical analysis of bank conflicts
on such data dependent access patterns is a challenging open
problem. For this reason, we do not attempt to analyze bank
conflicts theoretically. Instead, we let β denote an average
number of bank conflicts that occur for a particular set of
shared memory accesses, measure it empirically, and incor-
porate it into our performance estimate. Since β is typically
only a function of the input and/or the algorithm, we can
measure it on one architecture and use it to estimate the
performance on a range of GPUs.
4 STATE-OF-THE-ART GPU SORTING
While a number of sorting algorithms have been proposed
for GPU architectures [1, 3, 8, 15, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29], the
CUB [26], Thrust [15], and MGPU [3] libraries currently pro-
vide the fastest sorting implementations. We focus our anal-
ysis on MGPU mergesort, because Thrust employs a similar
comparison-based algorithm and CUB is not a comparison-
based algorithm.
4.1 MGPU Mergesort
The modernGPU (MGPU) library [3] is a collection of highly
optimized implementations of fundamental algorithms for
modern GPU architectures. While MGPU is not frequently
updated, many of its implementations remain the fastest

independent merge lists to satisfy all thread-blocks, where
each thread-block contains w = 32 threads. Since groups of
K lists are merged at each round, partitions are found across
all K lists using a search method based on K binary searches
proposed by Hayashi et al. [14].

The merging of K lists by w threads is accomplished with
the use of a variation of a minHeap structure. This struc-
ture stores 2w elements in sorted order at each node, where
all elements satisfy the heap property (every element in a
node x is smaller than every element in its children y and z).
This allows I/O-efficient reading and writing of blocks of w
elements at a time while sorting.

Estimating performance – As with MGPU, we omit the
details of our analysis of the multiway mergesort of Koike
and Sadakane and refer interested readers to Karsin’s dis-
sertation [18] for the full analysis. We were unable to ob-
tain an implementation of the algorithm presented by Koike
and Sadakane [21], so we cannot accurately determine I.
We, therefore, assume I = 1, since, while merging, each
operation is dependent on the result of the previous opera-
tion. Each warp works on its own heap structure, requiring
4Kw − 2w elements in shared memory, limiting multiplic-
ity to X =
4K P−2P . We estimate the execution time of the
algorithm by Koike and Sadakane [21] as:

Our performance estimate indicates that, as K grows, the
relative impact of shared memory accesses increases. When
K = 32, more than 75% of the execution time is due to shared
memory accesses. Furthermore, since multiplicity decreases
with increased K, on Algoparc accesses to shared memory
and global memory become latency-bound when K ≥ 3 and
K ≥ 6, respectively.
5 GPU-MMS
The main bottlenecks for the MGPU mergesort are global
memory bandwidth and shared memory bank conflicts. While
the multiway mergesort proposed by Koike et al. [21] ad-
dresses these bottlenecks, its performance is limited by the
large amount of shared memory it accesses and low multiplic-
ity. In this section, we present GPU-MMS, our GPU-efficient
multiway mergesort algorithm that avoids the performance
bottlenecks of both of these algorithms.
5.1 Algorithm Overview
We use the algorithm by Koike and Sadakane [21] as a start-
ing point, but present several improvements that address

mergesort on our three hardware platforms, estimate op-
timal parameter values (e.g., E), and identify bottlenecks.
Figure 3 shows our throughput estimate as E varies, on the
Algoparc platform, along with the throughput measured
when running MGPU. These results indicate that our esti-
mate correctly predicts the best value for E to be 31, despite
MGPU using E = 15 for Maxwell generation GPUs, like that
on Algoparc. Our overall execution time estimate has an
average relative error of 7.48%.

On all three platforms, our estimate indicates that between
65% and 75% of execution time is due to global memory ac-
cesses. The remaining portion of execution time is attributed
to shared memory accesses. We measure β for merging and
partition phases to be 3.1 and 2.2, respectively, indicating that
bank conflicts contribute roughly 15-20% to overall execution
time. We conclude that MGPU suffers from two primary per-
formance bottlenecks: global memory bandwidth and shared
memory bank conflicts.
4.2 Koike and Sadakane’s Multiway

Mergesort

Pairwise mergesort requires O(log2 N) merge rounds, where
N elements must be read from (and written to) global mem-
ory at each round, leading to the global memory bottleneck
seen in our analysis of MGPU in the previous section. This
naturally suggests the use of a multiway mergesort algo-
rithm [20] to reduce the number of merge rounds. According
to the (sequential) external memory model [2], multiway
mergesort achieves optimal I/O complexity when K = M
B ,
where M is the size of internal memory and B is the access
block size [20]. Koike and Sadakane [21] present a multiway
mergesort for GPUs.

Algorithm Overview – The multiway mergesort of Koike
and Sadakane [21] starts by sorting blocks of w elements
in internal memory (“base case”). Groups of K sorted lists
are then merged until the entire input is sorted. At each
merge round, partitions are needed if there are not enough

its performance bottlenecks. In a nutshell, GPU-MMS maxi-
mizes multiplicity and ILP while reducing both shared mem-
ory and global memory accesses. We present the following
improvements over the algorithm of Koike and Sadakane [21].
Parallel heap – We first focus our design on reducing the
shared memory usage to increase X and thereby improve
performance for larger values of K. Recall that the heap used
by Koike and Sadakane stores 2w elements at each node,
requiring 4Kw − 2w elements in shared memory per heap.
We present an improved heap structure, which we call a
minBlockHeap, that requires half the shared memory, while
still allowing all w threads to work cooperatively and access
only blocks of w elements at a time from global memory.
Each node x contains a list of w elements (x[0], . . . , x[w −
1]), stored in sorted order, and we define the fillEmptyNode
operation that fills an empty node (i.e., a node without any
elements in its list). Consider x to be an empty node with
non-empty children y and z. W.l.o.g. assume that y[w − 1] >
z[w − 1]. The f illEmptyNode(x) operation is performed as
follows: merge the lists of y and z, fill x with the w smallest
elements, fill y with the w largest elements, and set z as
empty. Since, prior to merging, y had the largest element
(y[w − 1]), its new largest element has not changed and the
heap property holds for y. We continue down the tree by
calling f illEmptyNode(z) until we reach a leaf, which we
fill by loading w new elements from global memory. This
structure provides two benefits over the heap used in [21]:
(i) the shared memory required to store each heap is reduced
to 2Kw −w elements and (ii) the number of elements merged
is reduced from 4w and 2w at each level. We note that, a small
K value results in a smaller heap, increasing K reduces the
total number of merge rounds. Thus K provides a tradeoff
between shared memory usage and global memory accesses.
Merging in registers – A primary drawback of using a
minBlockHeap type structure is that, since w threads are
merging pairs of w elements, a work-efficient sequential
merge cannot be used. Koike and Sadakane [21] employ
a bank conflict-free bitonic merge network [20] in shared
memory, increasing shared memory accesses by a factor
log w. To reduce the cost of this work-inefficient merge, we
develop a merge step for GPU-MMS that operates in registers.
While this causes GPU-MMS to be work-inefficient, the extra
work is done in low-latency registers that have much higher
peak bandwidth. We accomplish this register merge with the
use of __shfl(), a hardware instruction that lets threads
within a warp access each others’ registers. This enables us
to reduce the number of shared memory accesses in favor of
faster register operations.
Independent merging – In addition to increasing X we
increase I with the following optimization to the minBlock-
Heap. After we extract the smallest w elements from the
heap, all w threads working on the heap identify the path of

Figure 4 Estimated throughput of GPU-MMS, com-
pared with the measured performance on Algoparc
with N = 228 for a range of K values. Estimated
throughput also shown for Koike and Sadakane’s mul-
tiway mergesort [21].

merge nodes from the root to the leaf. This path corresponds
to the node at each level of the heap that will be emptied
during merging. Starting at the root, each thread loads one
element from each child into registers, and continues down
the path of the child with the smallest (w − 1)-th element.
There are total of log K nodes along this path, so each thread
loads a total of 2 log K elements into registers. Since each
merge operation is independent, we interleave the opera-
tions, thereby increasing I by a factor log K. This comes at
the cost of using additional registers. However, this is not
an issue on our hardware, so shared memory remains the
primary factor limiting multiplicity.

Increased base case – MGPU mergesort sorts its base
case of tE elements using pairwise mergesort, though this
results in bank conflicts, reducing performance. Koike and
Sadakane [21] avoid bank conflicts in the base case by letting
each thread sort w elements within its own memory bank,
resulting in smaller base case. We increase the base case
by sorting w2 items in shared memory by using the bank
conflict-free algorithm of Afshani and Sitchinava [1].
5.2 Performance Analysis
Aside from reducing shared memory accesses by a factor
log w, GPU-MMS does not significantly improve asymptotic
performance over [21]. However, GPU-MMS improves many
of the constant factors that have a practical impact on execu-
tion time. Though we omit details due to limited space, our
analysis of accesses to each type of memory results in:

E = 31, rather than the standard E = 15.

M

where Tr is the time spent performing computations in reg-
isters. Note that we require 6N register accesses per merge
round due to the merge network requiring 3 operations:
__shfl(), min(), and max(). Furthermore, the use of a merg-
ing network means that GPU-MMS is not work-efficient, as
merging w elements takes O(w log w) work. Note that the w2
is due to the increased size of the base case. Since our heap
uses less memory, multiplicity is increased to X =
2K P−P .
Furthermore, independent merging increases I to log K.
Figure 4 shows our performance estimate and measured
execution time of our GPU-MMS implementation, on Al-
goparc, for N = 228 and varying values of K. We also
show a performance estimate for the algorithm of Koike and
Sadakane [21] to illustrate the impact of the improvements
included in GPU-MMS. Results indicate that these improve-
ments significantly increase overall performance, especially
when K is larger. However, even with the increased X and
I, the ideal value of K is still either 8 or 16 on Algoparc.
On our other two hardware platforms, both our analysis and
empirical results indicate that K = 8 leads to the best perfor-
mance. Thus, in all that follows we use K = 16, K = 8, and
K = 8 on Algoparc, Gibson, and Uhhpc, respectively, un-
less otherwise noted. To verify that our GPU-MMS algorithm
does not suffer from the performance bottlenecks that we
see with MGPU mergesort and Koike and Sadakane’s multi-
way mergesort [21], we consider the estimated percentage
of overall runtime due to each component of execution. Our
performance estimate indicates that, unlike MGPU merge-
sort and Koike and Sadakane’s mergesort, no single type of
operation dominates execution time. Furthermore, register
operations make up a significant portion of overall execution
time (35%), indicating that GPU-MMS performance is not
bound by high-latency memory accesses.
6 EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISONS
The analysis and results in the previous section indicate
that our GPU-MMS algorithm provides key advantages over

8

the Thrust and MGPU pairwise mergesorts, as well as the
multiway mergesort presented by Koike and Sadakane [21].
While we were unable to get code for the algorithm in [21],
the improvements outlined in the previous section and an-
alytical results illustrated in Figure 4 indicate that GPU-
MMS should outperform [21] in all cases. We compare GPU-
MMS performance with three leading GPU sorting libraries:
Thrust 1.8.1 [15], MGPU 2.10 [3], and CUB 1.6.4 [26]. As
discussed in Section 4, Thrust and MGPU provide two of
the fastest comparison-based sorts available for GPUs, while
CUB provides the fastest radix sort. Although CUB is not a
comparison-based sort (limitations discussed in Section 1),
we include it in some of our experiments for completeness.
We also include the I/O-efficient samplesort implementation
of [23] in some of our experiments.
6.1 Sorting Random Integers
Figure 5 shows the average throughput achieved by each
algorithm when applied to random inputs of 4-byte integers,
on each of our hardware platforms. These results show that
GPU-MMS outperforms all other comparison-based sorting
algorithms for all input sizes. As expected, CUB, being a radix
sort, achieves much higher throughput across all input sizes.
On Algoparc, GPU-MMS outperforms MGPU an average of
32.27%, across all input sets. Even when using the improved
value of E = 31 for MGPU (as determined by our analysis
in Section 4.1), GPU-MMS still outperforms MGPU for most
input sets. On Gibson and Uhhpc, GPU-MMS is 23.26% and
11.48% faster than MGPU, respectively. We note that, unlike
on Algoparc, for Gibson and Uhhpc, MGPU performs best
when using the hard-coded E = 11 value.
6.2 Impact of Bank Conflicts
A feature of GPU-MMS is that, regardless of input, it is free of
shared memory bank conflicts. MGPU and Thrust, however,
have memory access patterns that depend on the input and
may therefore result in bank conflicts. Since the memory

heavy input on the Gibson platform.

access patterns of MGPU and Thrust are deterministic, by
carefully analyzing the access patterns of the algorithm, we
generate a conflict-heavy input permutation that will cause
these algorithms to incur large numbers of bank conflicts, for
a given E. Since the optimal values of E may differ, we create
conflict-heavy inputs specifically for each value of E (11 and
15). Figure 6 shows the average throughput achieved when
sorting a conflict-heavy input set on the Gibson platform.
These results indicate that both Thrust and MGPU suffer
from significant performance degradation due to bank con-
flicts on the conflict-heavy input, while GPU-MMS achieves
performance similar to a random input sequence. On these
conflict-heavy inputs, GPU-MMS is, on average, 71.1%, 68.3%,
and 54.6% faster than MGPU (67.2%, 63.4%, and 49.5% faster
than Thrust) on Algoparc, Gibson, and Uhhpc, respectively.
6.3 Sorting Other Data Types
As seen from Figure 5, the CUB radix sort implementation
significantly outperforms all comparison-based sorting al-
gorithms, including GPU-MMS. However, as discussed in
Section 1, it is not always possible to use radix sort efficiently.
In this section we present an experimental comparison of
MGPU and GPU-MMS when sorting more complex data
types using user-defined comparison functions. We consider
sorting (a) key-value pairs, (b) points in the plane using l1
norm (Manhattan distance) from the origin, and (c) rational
numbers. Each of the three data types are stored as objects of
two 32-bit integers x and y. The relative order of two objects
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is resolved according to the outcome of
comparing (a) x1 and x2, (b) |x1| + |y1| and |x2| + |y2|, and (c)
x1 · y2 and x2 · y2.
There are two factors that affect the performance of GPU-
MMS on these data types. First, recall that GPU-MMS mini-
mizes accesses to global memory by increasing utilization of
shared memory, which is parameterized by K – the number
of sequences being merged simultaneously. By increasing
the size of the data types from a single integer to pairs of
integers (or 32-bit floating point numbers), we effectively

ing: key-value pairs, (x,y) coordinates by their l1 dis-
tance from origin, and rational numbers, represented
as integer numerator and denominator pairs.

reduce the shared memory size by a factor of 2. Thus, larger
data types force GPU-MMS to use a smaller value of K to
maintain adequate multiplicity. This increases the number
of merge rounds and potentially degrades GPU-MMS’s per-
formance. MGPU, on the other hand, uses a small amount
of shared memory and must perform a suboptimal O(log N)
number of merge rounds, regardless of the size of the data
types. Second, recall that, while MGPU’s performance is pri-
marily bounded by global memory accesses (Section 4.1),
GPU-MMS is nearly-perfectly balanced between computa-
tions and global memory accesses (Section 5.2). As a result,
the performance impact of increasing the cost of each com-
parison will be more apparent for GPU-MMS than MGPU.
Figure 7 plots the average throughput of GPU-MMS and
MGPU when sorting random inputs of each of the datatypes
we consider, on Gibson. When sorting key-value pairs, de-
spite the increased memory requirement (and decrease in
K) we observed that GPU-MMS still outperforms MGPU
on all input sizes by an average of 15.8%, 13.5%, and 12.3%
on Algoparc, Gibson, and Uhhpc, respectively. We note
that, since the value can be defined as a pointer to an ar-
bitrary object, this experiment encompasses values of any
data type. When sorting by the l1 norm, GPU-MMS is on
average, 6.6% and 1.5% faster, and 4.6% slower than MGPU on
Gibson, Uhhpc, and Algoparc, respectively. When sorting
fractions, MGPU outperforms GPU-MMS by an average of
just 0.6%, 3.1%, and 5.4% on Gibson, Uhhpc, and Algoparc,
respectively. As expected, since MGPU is memory-bound,
the increased computation has less of an impact on MGPU’s
overall performance. Nevertheless, GPU-MMS remains com-
petitive. This performance loss due to increased computation
during a comparison confirms that GPU-MMS is not memory
bound and makes more balanced use of the massive compute
capabilities of modern GPUs.

7 CONCLUSIONS
This work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art GPU-efficient
algorithm may suffer from avoidable performance bottle-
necks. Analytical frameworks and theoretical models let us
identify these bottlenecks and develop new, more effective
algorithms. Furthermore, these models let us study how hard-
ware changes would impact runtimes. Our analysis shows
that a larger shared memory size would increase the relative
performance improvement of GPU-MMS over MGPU. The
latest NVIDIA architectures provide larger shared memory
sizes than their predecessors. Thus, we expect GPU-MMS to
outperform MGPU by larger margins on future systems.

While we focus on comparison-based sorting algorithms,
the analytical techniques presented in this work are general
enough that they may be useful for developing other GPU-
efficient algorithms. In particular, the relationship between
latency, bandwidth, and parallelism are key to achieving peak
GPU performance, regardless of the algorithm itself. Along
these lines, we have continued this work and applied this an-
alytical framework to the problem of general matrix-matrix
multiplication and determined that the currently available
library implementation [34] achieves optimal performance
on our GPU platforms [18].

Abstract 

 

Cultivating collective innovation while preserving 
the interest of the individual contributors is one of the 
main  challenges  collaborative  innovation  networks 
face.  This  challenge  is  riddled  with  difficulties  in 
managing  individuals’  co-innovation  risks.  The  first 
step  toward  understanding  co-innovation  risks  is  the 
development of a valid and reliable model to measure 
risk.  This  paper 
the  actors’  perception  of 
conceptualizes  co-innovation  risk 
from  actor’s 
perspective. It also proposes and tests a nomological 
network  that  illustrates  the  effect  of  risk  on  co-
innovation behavior.  

 
 

1. Introduction  

 
Co-innovation business models and strategies have 
transformational  capacity 
in  helping  businesses 
develop new ideas and bring them to market [1]–[3]. 
External co-innovators, referred to as “actors” in this 
paper,  are  the  main  capitals  for  all  co-innovation 
project.  While  many  factors  may  ultimately  impact 
success  or  failure  of  co-innovation  projects,  all  else 
being equal, the success of a co-innovation project is 
contingent  upon  the  amount  and  quality  of  the 
resources (e.g. time, knowledge) actors dedicate to the 
project. However, whether or not actors are willing to 
participate 
their 
resources depends on the benefit and risk estimation of 
contribution.  Understating  the  factors  that  affect 
actors’  perception  of  benefits  and  risks  is  critical  to 
maintaining the productivity of co-innovation. To this 
end,  our  paper  focuses  on  risks  that  may  discourage 
actors’ participation and contribution.  

in  co-innovation  and  dedicate 

While risks in co-innovation have been an area of 
Information Systems (IS) research interest [4], risks at 
the individual level have received less attention from 
academia  compared 
to  organizational  risk.  The 
research efforts to date have  also  led to inconclusive 
models of co-innovation behavior due to the absence 
of a comprehensive framework to examine the benefits 
and  risks  at  the  same  time.  To  address  this  gap,  this 
paper  reports  on  the  development  of  an  instrument

designed  to  conceptualize  and  measure  the  various 
aspects  of  co-innovation  risk  affecting  co-innovation 
ideation,  collaboration,  and 
processes,  namely 
communication [5]. Although the focus of this paper is 
on  risk  in  co-innovation  networks,  the  measurement 
instrument developed is applicable more generally to 
a variety of open innovations models. 

In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  perceived  risk  of  co-
innovation (in short, co-innovation risk), defined as an 
actor’s perception of potential losses in contributing to 
co-innovation,  and  conceptualized  based  on  the 
characteristics  of  individual  risk  revealed  in  a  case 
study. Measurement items were then developed on the 
basis  of  the  case  data  and  existing  literature.  The 
resulting instrument was subjected to a pilot test and a 
field  study,  and  demonstrated  acceptable  levels  of 
reliability  and  validity.  The  result  is  a  15-item 
instrument comprising four sub-scales, which provide 
a useful tool for the study of co-innovation risks and 
their relationships with actors’ behaviors. 

 

2. Literature and theory  

 
Gloor [11: 4] defined a co-innovation network as 
“a  cyberteam  of  self-motivated  people  with  a 
collective vision, enabled by the Web to collaborate in 
achieving  a  common  goal  by  sharing 
ideas, 
information,  and  work.”  Stakeholders 
in  a  co-
innovation  network  typically  come  from  diverse 
backgrounds 
to  work  collectively  on  problems 
presented  to,  or  proposed  by,  members  of  the  co-
innovation  network  [3],  [6]–[8].  With  rapid  growth 
and diffusion of social technologies, the co-innovation 
model has expanded to encompass networks of actors 
who  not  only  contribute  to  innovation  activities  but 
also  lead  the  process  [9]–[13].  The  application  of 
social technologies in co-innovation [13], [14] extends 
open innovation  beyond customer virtual community 
or open source community models to socially-engaged 
individual  actors  fully  involved  in  all  phases  of  new 
product  development  [6],  [15].  This  high  level  of 
participation can directly affect the value co-creation 
across  the  innovation  cycle.  Understanding  factors 
affecting actors’ participation, therefore, is crucial  to 
improving the co-innovation process and outcomes.

2.1.  Co-innovation risk 

 
Innovation  is  the  function  of  creativity  and  risk 
taking  [16].  However,  there  is  a  limited  amount  of 
empirical research on co-innovation risk management 
[17].  Previous  studies  mainly  focused  on  mitigating 
the risks met by companies in their innovation process 
or  on  risk-sharing  between  co-innovators  [18],  [19]. 
For  example,  Enkel  et  al.,  discussed  co-innovation 
risks  such  as  loss  of  knowledge,  higher  coordination 
costs,  loss  of  control,  and  higher  complexity  [20]. 
However,  co-innovation  risks  are  not  limited  to  the 
organizational  level;  individual  risk  assessment  is 
necessary when actors play key roles in co-innovation 
process  [19].  Overlooking  actor-related  risks 
is 
regarded as a major threat to co-innovation [17]. 

Minimizing  individual  risks  is  at  the  heart  of  the 
risk  management  [21]  and  actor  retention  strategy  in 
co-innovation networks [19]. Thus, to sustain the co-
innovation  process,  understanding  and  addressing 
individual risks as one of the major hindrances would 
be  worthwhile.  At  the  actor  level,  the  risk  of  co-
innovation  is  conceptualized  as  the  expectation  of 
individual’s 
the  participation  or 
contribution to co-innovation  process.  The perceived 
risks affect actors’ intention to achieve co-innovation 
goals [22].

2.2.  Co-Innovation behavior and risk 

is  mainly  associated  with 

 
The co-innovation network business model defines 
the  scope  of  external  actors’  involvement  in  co-
innovation, which is the basis for understanding actor 
behavior.  Subsuming  variations  in  the  scope  of 
activities,  Gloor  proposes 
three  general  and 
fundamental  dimensions  of  actor  participation  in 
collaborative  communities:  creativity,  collaboration, 
and  communication  [1].  In  co-innovation  networks, 
creativity  is  referred  to  as  ideation  or  co-creation  of 
new  product  ideas  [23].  The  risk  in  the  ideation 
process 
the 
intellectual property right with the collaborators [24]. 
Another example is performance risk, which refers to 
the  possibility  that  a  new  product  or  service  is  not 
performing as it was designed and, therefore, failing to 
deliver the benefits that were originally intended [25].  
among 
internal  and  external  actors  to  address  problems  and 
find or improve solutions [13]. Losing time and other 
resources over unsuccessful partnership are examples 
of risks associated with the collaboration efforts [26].  
Because of the distributed nature of the co-innovation  
model, communication between actors such as sharing 
information  and  knowledge  is  an  inherent  aspect 
throughout co-innovation processes and activities [6].

community  may  limit  communication  among  the 
actors  [27].  An  understanding  of  the  relationship 
between  risks  and  these  dimensions  is  important  for 
predicting  actor  behavior.  The  first  step  toward  this 
goal is the development of a valid and reliable model 
to measure the actors’ perception of risk. 
 
3. Method 

 
The construct development was carried out in six 
phases  [28].  The  first  phase,  the  case  study,  helped 
with  construct  conceptualization.  Studying 
the 
construct  attributes  in  a  natural  setting  supported 
measurement  development  [25],  [26]  by  providing 
supplementary  sources  of  evidence  for  the  construct 
development  [27].  The  second  phase  was  construct 
operationalization  with  the  goal  of  creating  pools  of 
items  from  existing  scales  and  the  case  study. 
Following  these  steps,  the  construct  was  developed 
and the scales were selected for further examination.  
In the third phase, the scale and sub-scale were pre-
tested for face validity and content validity. The fourth 
phase, the pre-test of the questionnaire helped ensure 
that the items are valid in co-innovation context. In the 
fifth  phase,  the  pilot  study,  the  instrument  was 
distributed to a small sample of active co-innovators, 
and  an  analysis  of  the  responses  was  conducted  to 
establish  the  scales’  reliability.  Items  that  did  not 
contribute to the reliability were culled for phase six, 
a full-scale field study. The field study was carried to 
further examine the instrument validity and reliability 
within the context. Sub-scales were further refined in 
this  last  phase.  In  this  phase,  we  also  explored  the 
instrument’s predictive validity.  

 

4. Construct development process 

 
To  characterize  co-innovation  risk,  we  used  the 
theory  of  perceived  risk  [29]–[31]  and  studied  the 
connections  between  co-innovation  activities  and  its 
undesirable consequences [24]. Then, we conducted a 
case study of a co-innovation network to supplement 
the  literature  for  a  better  understanding  of  the 
perceived risks in the context.  

The  theory  suggested  that  perceived  risk  can  be 
conceptualized  as  a  combination  of  uncertainty  plus 
seriousness  of  outcome  involved  [30],  and  can  be 
modeled  as  the  expectation  of  losses  associated  with 
co-innovation  [32].  To  understand  the  co-innovation 
risk,  we  should  consider  expectation  of  losses  in 
relationship to the actors’ goals and expectations [33]. 
Therefore, it is sufficient to model the expectation of 
losses  as  the  uncertainty  of  achieving  personal  co-
innovation goals [34], [35]. To capture this concept, IS 
studies  adapted  consumer  behavior  literature  and  in 
particular,  Cunningham’s  [36]  six  dimensions  of 

874

perceived  risk:  financial,  performance,  social,  time, 
safety, and psychological loss [31], [35], [37].  

Perceived  financial  risk  (or  economic  risk)  is 
associated  with  the  possible  loss  of  money  in  the 
adaptation  of  an  information  system  [38].  Financial 
risk in co-innovation business models is twofold: risk 
associated  with  the  direct  financial  investment  of 
actors, and the opportunity cost of investment in one 
network  but  not  in  the  others  [41].  Perceived 
performance  risk  refers  to  actor  assessment  of 
potential  performance  problems––malfunctioning, 
processing errors, and reliability––and not performing 
as expected [37]. Performance risk can be associated 
with  both  network  outcomes  (i.e.  new  product  or 
service) or co-innovation platform performance  [39]. 
The  perceived  social  risk  is  defined  as  the  potential 
loss  of  status  in  one’s  social  group  as  a  result  of 
adopting  a  product  or  service  [31],  [35].  In 
collaborative  networks,  the  actor’s  behavior  or  the 
outcomes  of  her  behavior  may  result  in  possible 
disapproval by peers [40]. Perceived time risk refers to 
the  time  an  actor  may  lose  from  learning  how  to 
participate or if the participation does not satisfy their 
expectations [37]. Perceived security or privacy risk is 
the  expression  of  the  actor’s  fear  that  the  behavior 
could be harmful to privacy, such as potential loss of 
control  over  personal  information  [31],  [34].  Lastly, 
perceived psychological risk refers to mental anxiety 
associated with a behavior [37]. 

As  perceived  risk  is  context-based,  the  specific 
dimensions utilized in the measurement model depend 
on the use context [31]. Therefore, for this study, we 
conducted  a  case  study  to  select  and  adjust  the 
dimensions  based  on  the  context  of  co-innovation 
before generating the measurement items. 

 

5. Case study  

 
Since  the  concept  of  co-innovation  risks  at  the 
individual level has not been yet operationalized to our 
knowledge,  a  case  study  was  used  to  support  the 
construct  development  and  generate  an  initial  set  of 
items. The case study helped us characterize risk as a 
set of vulnerabilities that negatively affect the actor’s 
ability to achieve co-innovation goals [21], [22]. The 
case  data  were  collected  from  a  particular  co-
innovation network, Quirky. Quirky is a co-innovation 
network  enabling  its  individual  members  to  initiate 
and fully participate in new product development. As 
part  of  the  Quirky  ideation  process,  prospective 
inventors  can  submit  their  ideas  for  community 
evaluation.  The  submitted  ideas,  if  selected,  are 
collaboratively  developed,  and  commercialized  by 
network  members.  The  developed  product  ideas  are 
then put into production and then sold by the company. 
Complementary  data  was  collected  from  Quirky 

because  its  business  model  is  more  comprehensive 
than other networks  due to the higher levels of actor 
involvement  and 
the  variety  of  co-innovation 
processes  and  social  engagements.  Therefore,  the 
numerous co-innovation opportunities in this network 
along with the publicly available data provided a rich 
phenomenon  to  study.  This  case  demonstrated  a 
prototypical  and,  at  the  same  time,  a  comprehensive 
model  of  co-innovation.  Different  data  sources 
including observation and interview were used in this 
case study.  

The  first  type  of  risk  highlighted  in  the  forum 
discussions  and  interview  was  IP  risk  in  terms  of 
potential  loss  due  to  use,  abuse,  or  misuse  of  the 
actor’s contribution by the company or other external 
actors  without  informing,  getting  permission,  and 
providing  fair  compensation.  This  risk  covered  a 
diverse  range  of  legally  protected  rights  such  as 
patents, copyrights, and designs, as well as other forms 
of  intangibles  such  as  human  capital,  and  contract 
rights. Many actors believed that they are vulnerable 
to lose their right while participating in co-innovation.  
The second most cited risk was financial risk (the 
potential for direct and indirect monetary loss) due to 
investment in the co-innovation activities. There is a 
risk  that  costs  becoming  bigger  than  the  expected 
benefits  of  co-innovation.  Quirky’s  members  do  not 
receive  any  monetary  compensation  if  their  ideas 
cannot make through the development process or the 
network  structure  limits  some  forms  of  financial 
compensations  due  to  the  internal  rule  or  policies. 
Direct  financial  risk  refers,  for  example,  to  losing 
submission fee due to unsuccessful new product idea. 
Indirect  financial  risks  are  associated  with  the 
financial  investment  in  preparing  a  new  idea,  for 
example, preparing a product idea rendering. 

Quirky’s  members  were  also  concerned  about 
losing time and inconvenience incurred due to failing 
to  submit  a  winning  idea  or  wasting  time  during 
collaboration due to incompetent collaborators or the 
processes  complexity,  for  example.  Co-innovation 
process is a time sensitive process due to the  market 
competition  and  IP  right  recordation.  Therefore, 
Quirky’s members believe that the opportunity cost of 
time is high if the co-innovation project fails after long 
waiting time.  

Lastly,  some  actors  were  concerned  about  losing 
their  reputation  in  the  Quirky  socio-professional 
environment due to failures in co-innovation. The new 
category of perceived social or reputation risk involves 
the  likelihood  that  co-innovation  affects  the  way 
others  think  of  the  co-innovator  since  the  Quirky 
publicly announces the actors’ success and failure. We 
thus conceptualize reputation risk as the potential loss 
of  status  in  one’s  social  or  professional  group,  as  a 
result  of  contribution  seems  against  the  norm  or  the 

875

group standard.  It is supported by the personal value 
theory claim about the risk perception within a social 
community [21]. This fact increases the perception of 
risk associated with reputation or social presence.  

The case study revealed that the actors’ intention 
to co-innovation depends on how they feel about the 
risks  associated  with  all  aspects  of  co-innovation 
behavior. We observed the importance of four out of 
six  categories  of  risk  namely  financial,  security  (as 
intellectual  property),  time  and  social  (as  reputation) 
risks. The prior studies on perceived risk support the 
importance of all four dimensions [35] [41] [42].  

Financial  risk  is  the  probability  that  actors  will 
lose  money  as  a  result  of  co-innovation.  Intellectual 
property (IP) right risk is the potential loss of control 
over IP without  fair compensation, such as royalties, 
or use of the creative idea without actor’s permission. 
Time  risk  refers  to  the  time  actors  may  lose  by 
participating  in  co-innovation  due  to  unsuccessful 
contribution  or  unproductive  co-innovation  process. 
The  case  result  did  not  support  the  inclusion  of 
performance  and  psychological  risks.  It  might  be 
because these dimensions are mainly related to the co-
innovation process, not outcomes. It is reasonable as 
we conceptualized perceived risk as the expectation of 
losses in relationship to the actors’ goals and not co-
innovation process [35]. 

After  conceptualizing  the  co-innovation  risk  as  a 
multidimensional  construct,  the  next  step  was  the 
generation  of  items  for  sub-scales.  Table  1  provides 
examples of items emerged from the case study. The 
questionnaire  was  developed  based  on  the  existing 
instrumented  [31],  [34],  [35],  [37]  and  then  adjusted 
based on the insight from the case study.

6. Pre-test of scale items  

 
The  items  generated  through  the  case  study  were 
refined into the measurement instrument through two 

processes:  the  pretest  of  the  measurement  items  and 
the  pretest  of  the  questionnaire.  These  tests  were 
conducted to identify problems in item  selection and 
comprehension, so as to improve the content and face 
validity of the instrument. 

First, measurement items and their categorization 
were  examined  through  two  rounds  of  card-sorting, 
which helped establish the face validity and confirmed 
the  grouping  and  labeling  within  the  context.  Card-
sorting was conducted in accordance with established 
guidelines [43]. This technique helped test the initial 
conceptualization  and 
the 
proposed  items.  In  both  card-sorting  exercises,  the 
randomly  listed  items  along  with  the  names  and 
definition  of  the  constructs  were  distributed  to  32 
judges  from  our  research  community.  The  judges 
separately sorted each item to a most proper construct, 
marked it as ‘Does not fit any category’, or marked it 
as ‘Does not make sense or is confusing.’

After the first card sorting, inter-rater reliabilities 
(Cohen’s  Kappa)  were  calculated  to  identify  the 
problematic 
the 
acceptable level of 0.65. In the first round, the judges 
sorted  24  items  with  the  flexibility  of  adding  new 
groups  to  the  initial  four  groups.  Five  items  were 
reworded  based  on  the  judges’  feedback.  After  the 
refinement, the same procedure was followed for the 
second  card-sorting  but  with  judges  from  the  target 
population. Thirty members of Quirky were invited to 
sort 19 items to four categories. This second phase of 
card-sorting  indicated  three  redundant  items,  which 
were removed before the questionnaire pre-test. 

 

7. Pre-test of questionnaire 

 
The  newly  developed  items  were  included  in  a 
questionnaire  that  examined  co-innovation  risk  and 
co-innovation intention. All items were constructed as 
7-point  Likert-type  scaled  questions  [44]  to  avoid 
collapsed  variance  and  maintain  the  consistency  of 
responses. The questions in each group were ordered 
randomly.  We  pretested  the  questionnaire  using 
‘expert  panel  technique’  recommended  by  Creswell 
[45].  This  method  helped  identify  the  possible 
weaknesses in the  construction of the questions such 
as possible sources of bias or order effects. First, ten 
senior  researchers  were  invited  to  evaluate  the 
questionnaire 
(e.g. 
comprehension, burden), as well as format issues (e.g. 
flow, typographical errors, and order effects). Experts 
reviewed  the  questionnaire  and  shared  their  opinion 
with the researcher directly.

The  follow-up  probes  technique  was  employed 
next  to  identify  difficulties  in  the  questionnaire 
completion after revising the first draft based on expert 
feedback. In this stage, 20  graduate students familiar 

876

with co-innovation networks were invited to complete 
the questionnaire and comment on potential problems 
or  improvement.  Written  and  oral  comments  on  the 
questionnaire were aggregately considered to improve 
the  questionnaire.  Finally,  five  reviewers  were 
selected  from  the  Quirky  community  for  the  third 
follow-up probes. Quirky members provided insights 
on  the  entire  co-innovation  process  as  well  as  the 
terminology  used  in  the  co-innovation  community, 
facilitating further refinement and improvement. 

 

8. Measurement model specification 

 
We modeled co-innovation risk as a second-order 
formative construct [46] comprising of four first-order 
reflective constructs, namely Financial Risk, IP Right 
Risk, Socail Risk, and Time Risk (Figure 1). We used 
four criteria to determine the existence of a formative 
construct  [46]–[49]:  1)  the  predictability  of  the  risk 
construct by the proposed second order measures; 2) 
the sensitiveness of construct to the exclusion of any 
second-order measures; 3) the possibility of changing 
one  measure  without  requiring  a  change  in  all  other 
second-order  measures  of  the  construct;  and  4)  the 
existence  of  different  antecedents  and  consequences 
for the second-order measures.

Regarding the predictability of the risk construct, 
our  case  study  suggested  that  the  four  first-order 
constructs could exist independently of one another as 
each dimension of risk each  can partially predict the 
level  of  co-innovation  risk.  Thus,  measurements  of 
financial risk, IP  right risk,  social risk, and time risk 
cannot substitute for each other in the measurement of 
the co-innovation risk. Omitting  any one  would alter 
the  definition  and  comprehensiveness  of  the  higher-
order construct. There is also no empirical evidence or 
theoretical  reason  to  expect  the  four  second-order 

to  be  highly  correlated  and 

thus 
measures 
interchangeable.  Lastly,  four  second-order  measures 
can have different antecedents, and outcomes in terms 
of actor’ behavior. For example, an actor may limit her 
ideation  due  to  the  risk  of  losing  IP  right  but  keep 
collaborating with other actors. 

 

9. Pilot studies 

 
We  conducted  a  pilot  study  to  make  an  initial 
reliability  assessment  of  the  sub-scales  and  improve 
the instrument to achieve the desired reliability levels. 
The  pilot  study  was  a  full-scale  pilot  test  of  the 
questionnaire  using  respondents  from  the  target 
population. The sample for the pilot study was drawn 
from  the  Quirky  community  and  data  were  collected 
online.  About  650  Quirky  users  were  randomly 
selected  and  invited  to  participate  in  the  pilot  study. 
The respondents were also asked to provide feedback 
on  the  items,  format,  and  scaling.  The  respondents 
were  all  active  members  with  at  least  one-month 
experience  in  co-innovation.  A  total  of  72  usable 
questionnaires  were  returned.  Since  data  were 
normally distributed, this sample size was a reasonable 
size  for  multivariate  analysis  with  SEM-PLS  [50] 
using  SmartPLS  [51].  The  measurement  model  was 
tested in two steps using the techniques recommended 
by Hair and colleagues [44], [45]. The first step  was 
for first-order reflective construct examination and the 
latent  variables  estimation,  and  Step  2  was  for 
formative second-order constructs. 

First-order. Table 2 presents the overall quality of 
reflective measures. Cronbach’s alpha and composite 
reliability were calculated to test the reliability of data. 
In this stage, FNR4 (e.g. losing money by joining the 
network)  was  the  only  indicator  removed  from  the 
initial model with a factor loading less than 0.5. Before 
this item elimination, we checked the content validity 
to  ensure  that  the  domain  coverage  of  the  construct 
would not suffer. After removing FNR4, the Financial 
Risk composite reliability was improved to 0.916 and 
its  Cronbach’s  alpha  improved  to  0.88.  The  rest  of 
reflective constructs met the reliability criteria.

the  examination  of  cross-loadings.  Comparing  the 
loadings  indicated  if  an  item’s  loadings  on  its  own 
construct  are  in  all  cases  higher  than  all  of  its  cross 
loadings with other constructs. Moreover, the AVE of 
each  reflective  construct,  was  higher 
the 
construct’s highest squared correlation with any other 
construct.  These  tests  supported  the  discriminant 
validity  between  all  the  dimensions  of  co-innovation 
risk.  In  addition,  the  evaluation  of  factor  loading 
identified no cross-loading issues. 

than 

Second-order. The evaluation of the second-order 
construct as a formative construct included assessment 
of the formative indicators’ validity, multicollinearity, 
convergent  validity  (redundancy).  The  estimation  of 
indicator  validity  was  performed  using  the  PLS 
algorithm method with a bootstrapping of samples to 
calculate item weights and loading of each formative 
indicator. The t-values for each item’s weight (relative 
importance)  and  loading  (absolute  importance)  were 
significance. Multicollinearity tests showed that each 
indicator's  variance  inflation  factor  (VIF)  value  was 
less than the cut-off value of 5. Redundancy analysis 
was  then  conducted  to  establish  the  convergent 
validity by correlating each formative construct with a 
global  measure  for  that  construct.  Path  coefficients 
were  above  the  threshold  of  0.80,  providing  support 
for the convergent validity of the formative constructs. 
For the sake of brevity, the detailed results of second-
order construct evaluation are not presented here as we 
repeated the same process for the field study.

10. Field Study 

 
The final measurement items that were used in the 
field  test  are  listed  in  Table 3. The  data  for  the  field 
survey  were  collected  from  a  random  sample  of 
Quirky members. From 60,000 potential respondents, 
1,000  Quirky  members  were  randomly  invited  to 
participate  in  an  online  survey.  Of  the  320  Quirky’s 
members  who  responded  fifty-nine  responses  were 
removed due to the respondents’ lack of co-innovation 

experience or incomplete data, leaving a final sample 
of  261  usable  responses  for  analysis.  Demographic 
data  analysis  shows  that  all  relevant  types  of  the 
respondent  in  terms  of  gender,  age,  education,  and 
employment  were  included  in  the  sample;  therefore, 
the study obtained a productive and balanced sample.

Similar to the pilot test, the measurement  models 
of  co-innovation  risk  sub-scale  were  tested  as  four 
different  first-order  reflective  constructs.  Then,  the 
second-order  construct  of  co-innovation  risk  was 
examined as a four-dimensional formative construct. 

First-order.  The  evaluation  of  the  reflective 
measurement  model  included  the  test  of  indicator 
reliability,  internal  consistency,  convergent  validity, 
and  discrimination  validity.  The  loadings  of  the 
reflective indicators were examined in order to assess 
the  indicator  reliability.  As  presented  in  Table  4,  all 
constructs were found to have “good” to “very good” 
factor 
reliability 
(construct reliability)  was assessed by examining the 
Composite  Reliability  and  Cronbach’s  alpha  of  the 
constructs.  Table  5  shows  acceptable  composite 
reliability values and Cronbach’s alpha values for all 
the constructs, thus demonstrating acceptable internal 
consistency reliability for the first-order constructs.

Convergent  validity  was  again  assessed  using 
AVE. The acceptable standard is that the AVE of the 
constructs should exceed 0.5, which means the items 
share at least half of their variance with the construct. 
Table  5  shows  that  the  AVE  values  of  the  reflective 
measurement  model  of  the  research  are  greater  than 
0.5  with  values  ranging  from  0.683  to  0.784.  These 
values provided evidence that the convergent validity 
was  achieved  and  indicates  that  the  measures  used 

878

were  robust.  The  discriminant  validity  of  the  model 
was evaluated by examining the cross loading for each 
indicator.  It  was  found  that  the  loading  of  each 
indicator  with  its  own  construct  was  higher  than  its 
loading for other constructs. Discriminant validity was 
also examined using the Fornell-Larcker criterion. The 
second evidence of discriminant validity, the AVE of 
each  reflective  construct,  was  higher 
the 
construct’s highest squared correlation with any other 
construct.  Therefore,  analysis  of  cross-loadings  and 
Fornell-Larcker  criterion  showed  that  discriminant 
validity was perfectly established.

construct  was 
recommended  by  Hair  and  his  colleagues  [52],  [53]. 
Indicator  validity  was  of  interest  for  the  test  of  the 
second-order  construct  of  co-innovation  risk.  The 
estimation  of  this  validity  was  performed  using  the 
PLS  algorithm  method  with  a  bootstrapping  of 
samples to calculate item weights and loading of each 
formative indicator. The number of bootstrap samples 
was 5,000, and the number of cases was equal to the 
number  of  observations  in  the  original  sample.  Each 
item’s  weight,  loading,  and  associated  t-value  using 
bootstrapping were used to assess items’ significance. 
The weights and loadings of the formative indicators 
of the measurement model are given in Table 6. The 
second-order formative weights were only significant 
for FNR and TMR. Since both IPR and SCR sub-scale 
had  significant  loading  value  (respectively  0.53  and 
0.72,  p  <  0.00),  there  is  empirical  support  to  retain 
these  items  [49],  [50].  Since  the  loadings  were 
significant,  keeping  the  all  the  items  preserved  the 
content validity of  subscales [54].

Redundancy  analysis  was  conducted  to  establish 
the convergent validity by correlating each formative 
construct  with  a  single-item  global  measure  for  that 
construct.  The  path  coefficients  were  above  the 
threshold of 0.80 (p < 0.01) supporting the convergent 
validity (i.e. not redundant variable).  

The off-diagonal values in Table 8 are the square 
of  correlations  between  the  latent  constructs.  As  the 
evidence of independency, the AVE of each reflective 
construct  was  higher  than  the  construct’s  highest 
squared correlation with any other construct.

Formative  constructs  were  also  evaluated  for 
multicollinearity.  Multicollinearity  tests  showed  that 
each  indicator’s  VIF  value  was  less  than  the  cut-off 
value  of  5  (see,  Table  7).  Following  the  general 
guidelines of Hair et al., all formative indicators in this 
measurement model should be retained, as they were 

 
Lastly,  we  examined  the  nomological  or  predictive 
validity  by  testing  the  relationship  between  the  co-
innovation  risk  construct  and  its  consequence:  actor 
intention to co-innovation (Figure 2). We assumed that 
perceived co-innovation risk has a direct relationship 
with an actor’s goal-directed behavior. To support this 
claim  we  used  the  theory  of  goal-directed  behavior, 
which  explains  that  goal  intention  (or  decision  to 
perform  a  behavior)  at  cognitive  stage  involves  a 
consideration  of  the  risk  and  benefits  of  pursuing 
given  goals  [55].  IS  literature  shows  that  some 

879

cognitive  factors  such  as  a  negative  experience  and 
risk  can  play  a  role  in  demotivation.  Therefore, 
perceived individual risk can negatively affect the co-
innovation behavior. 

To  test  the  predictive  validity,  we  tested  the 
significance  of  the  direct  effect  between  the  co-
innovation  risk  construct  and  intention  to  contribute 
using  bootstrapping  procedures.  The  results  showed 
that co-innovation risk was negatively associated with 
intention to contribution (b = - 0.22, p < 0.05). 

Moreover,  further  analysis  showed 

that  co-
innovation  risk  was  also  negatively  associated  with 
three  dimensions  of  intention  to  contribute,  namely 
intention  to  ideate  (b  =  -0.42,  p  <  0.00),  intention  to 
collaborate  (b  =  -0.38,  p  <  0.00,  and  intention  to 
communicate (b = -0.22, p < 0.05) (see, Table 9). As a 
result, we concluded that an actor’s perception of co-
innovation  risk 
leads  unfavorable  or  favorable 
perceptions  of  co-innovation  that  in  turn  affect  their 
level  and  the  intensity  of  participation  in  terms  of 
ideation, collaboration, and communication.

11. Implications for theory & practice 

 
Risk perceived by actors is one of the key concerns 
in  co-innovation  business  model  implementations 
[56]. Westergren and Holmström  note that managing 
risks  in  a  co-innovation  network  is  a  key  task  for 
network coordinators [57]. By understanding different 
individual  risk  factors,  network  coordinators  can 
minimize the risk of participation by adjusting relevant 
co-innovation processes, rules, and policies [58], and 
as  a  result,  enhance  actors’  intentions  to  participate 
and contribute [59].

financial risk, IP right risk, time risk and  social risk. 
Our  field  test  confirmed  that  the  four  co-innovation

second-order formative construct. The final result is a 
reliable measurement instrument with 15 items in four 
sub-scales.

This instrument can be used to investigate how the 
perception of co-innovation risk affects actor intention 
to contribute to co-innovation. In addition to the solid 
results for construct validity, the predictive validity of 
the  construct  is  promising.  We  believe  that  the  final 
instrument  can  contribute  to  research  aimed  at

Understanding  co-innovation  risks  at  the  actor 
level can also help organizations acquire, encourage, 
and  retain  external  actors  more  efficiently,  which  is 
ultimately followed by better business outcomes. Once 
risks  are  assessed,  measured  and  monitored,  co-

The findings also have prescriptive value in the co-
innovation  network  governance.  Co-innovation 
networks  can  consider  the  factors  identified  in  this 
study in policy  making,  regulation development, and 
risk communication. The first step of risk management 
can consist of using the proposed measurement model 
in  identifying  risks  and  their  effects  on  actors’ 
participation and contribution. The second phase  can 
be  risk  mitigation  that  consists  of  prioritizing, 
implementing,  and  maintaining  the  appropriate  risk-
reducing  measures  recommended  by  the  first  phase, 
the risk assessment process. Following this phase, the 
instrument can be used in the continual evaluation of 
the mitigation strategies implemented to improve the 
co-innovation outcomes.

additional checks for validity and reliability would be 
prudent.  The study calls  for  more  scholarly attention 
to  the  role  perceived  risk  plays  in  influencing  co-
innovation  behavior.  We  suggest  that  researchers 
employ the proposed instrument to develop new, more 
rigorous  studies  to  further  clarify  the  role  of  co-
innovation risk. For example,  further investigation is 
needed  with  other  open 
to 
investigate the generalizability of the model as well as 
its  impacts  on  co-innovation  behavior  including 
contribution rate and quality.

1.  Introduction

For  analyzing  changes  in  an  individual's  health  over  time,  this  research  has  developed  objective  measures
for  comparing  behavioral  patterns,  including  sleep  quality  and  activity  scores.  These  novel  measures  of
behavioral  health  have  provided  insight  about  how  sleep  debt  accumulates  after  long,  extended  days,
how  sleep  disruption  and  recovery  from  wakefulness  occur  during  the  night,  and  when  cross-correlations
exist  between  measures.  This  data-driven  approach  to  quantifying  behavioral  patterns  is  informed  by
minute-by-minute  data  from  consumer-grade,  wrist-worn  wearables.  In  this  8-month  longitudinal
study,  Jawbone  UP  wristbands  and  the  Jawbone  UP  API  were  utilized  to  collect  minute-by-minute  data
about  the  behavior  of  crewmembers  participating  in  a  simulated  Mars  mission.  To  study  the  challenges  of
living  and  working  on  the  planet  Mars,  for  eight  months,  these  crewmembers  were  conﬁned  to  a  Mars-
like  habitat,  living  in  close  quarters,  isolated  from  the  rest  of  humanity  at  a  high  elevation  on  Mauna  Loa
volcano  in  Hawaii,  wearing  mock  spacesuits  while  exploring  the  volcanic  terrain,  consuming  shelf-stable
foods,  restricted  in  water  usage,  relying  on  solar  energy,  and  delayed  in  communications  with  20-min  lag-
times  for  delivering  messages  to  and  from  the  crew.  Analyzing  the  behavior  of  these  astronaut-like
individuals  has  led  to  the  development  of  objective  measures  for  quantifying  sleep  patterns,  that  have
potential  for  contributing  to  the  development  of  next-generation,  smart  wearables.

Toward  the  goal  of  understanding  behavioral  health  and
performance  challenges  that  astronauts  will  face  on  the 
ﬁrst
human  mission  to  Mars,  researchers  have  designed  Mars  analog
environments  for  immersing  crews  in  Mars-like  conditions  to
measure  biological,  psychological,  and  social  changes  over  time.
During  an  8-month  simulated  Mars  mission  conducted  by  Hawaii
Space  Exploration  Analog  and  Simulation  (HI-SEAS),  six  crew-
members  were  isolated  from  the  rest  of  humanity,  at  an  elevation
of  8200-feet  on  the  red,  rocky  slopes  of  Mauna  Loa  volcano  in
Hawaii  (Appendix  A).  Crewmembers  were  conﬁned  to  a  living
space  of  1000  square-feet  in  a  geodesic  dome  habitat,  except  when
going  outside  the  habitat  to  explore  the  volcanic  terrain  while

wearing  mock  spacesuits.  HI-SEAS  crewmembers  had  to  cope  with
group-living  in  close  quarters,  only  consumed  shelf-stable  foods,
were  restricted  in  water  usage,  relied  on  solar  energy,  and  had  20-
min 
lag-times  on  e-mail  systems  to  simulate  Earth  to  Mars
communication.

Conducting  wearables  research 

in  a  Mars  analog  research
environment  is  an  intermediate  step  between  laboratory  work  and
real-world  data  collection.  In  contrast  to  monitoring  directed
behaviors  for  short  periods  of  time  in  a  controlled  laboratory
setting,  crewmembers  are  behaving  autonomously  without  any
direction  from  researchers  on  how  to  schedule  their  sleep  and
activity  periods,  which  results  in  complex  data  that  is  similar  to
real  world  behavior.  This  research  environment  has  limited  modes
of  entertainment,  nutrition,  social  interaction,  and  work  projects
for  the  crew,  as  compared  to  the  innumerable  factors  on  health  and
behavior  in  the  real  world.  During  the  8-month  mission,  wrist-
worn  wearables  were  implemented  for  recording  sleep,  activity,
and  heart  rate  data  on  a  minute-by-minute  basis.,  These  data  have

potential  for  improving  self-awareness  and  crew  performance  by
promoting  behavioral  health  changes,  such  as  increased  activity
and  more  consistent  sleep  schedules.

“astronaut-like”

Minute-by-minute  wearable  device  data  collection  about  the
behavior  of  these 
ﬁrst  step  in
the  development  of  unobtrusive  behavioral  health  and  perfor-
mance  monitoring  systems  for  future  astronauts.  As  currently
planned,  a  mission  to  Mars  will  be  a  3-year  journey  for  a  small  crew
of  4-6  astronauts  who  will  need  to  be  resilient  to  the  stressors  of
isolated  and  conﬁned  living  conditions  in  a  highly  complex  work
environment  [1].  Remote  health  monitoring  has  useful  applica-
tions  for  astronauts  on  a  mission  to  Mars,  but  also  for  many  other
health  and  performance  applications,  including  at-home  patient
care,  athletic  training,  and  military  deployments.  Wearables,
mobile  applications,  and  telehealth  systems  enable  examinations
of  health  to  extend  beyond  intermittent  visits  with  coaches  and
medical  professionals.  Wearables  data  can  be  transferred  to
healthcare  providers  or  other  leaders  and  coaches  as  an  automated,
reliable  method  for  gaining  information  about  behavioral  patterns
that  reﬂect  lifestyle  choices  and  health  status,  and  wearable  users
can  receive  interpretations  of  these  data  as  well  as  reminders  and
incentives  for  continuing  treatment  plans  or  practice  regimens  to
promote  behavioral  health  changes  and  improved  performance.
Other  uses  of  behavioral  monitoring  with  wearables  may  include
health  education,  parenting  and  care-taking  in  families,  as  well  as
personal  challenges  to  incentivize  sleep  hygiene  and  consistent
exercise,  including  competitions  among  coworkers,  friends,  and
family.

By  recording  sleep  and  activity  data,  wearables  are  collecting
volumes  of  information  about  users.  However,  in  the  research
community,  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  accuracy  of  consumer-
grade,  wrist-worn  wearables  for  activity,  sleep,  and  heart  rate
measurement.  Consumer-grade  devices  have  not  reached  a  level  of
acceptability  to  replace  gold-standard  research  methods,  such  as
polysomnography;  however,  collecting  data  about  a  large  popula-
tion  offers 
  value,  as  it  is  estimated  that  over  60  million
people  in  the  United  States  are  using  consumer-grade  wearables,
such  as  Jawbone  and  Fitbit  wristbands  [2].  Although  consumer-
grade,  wrist-worn  wearables  data  are  less  accurate  than  clinical
research  tools  for  sleep  analysis,  this  research  is  leveraging  the
high  volume  of  data  collected  from  these  devices  to  analyze
changes  over  time  [3].

“big  data”

Here,  concepts  of  sleep  debt,  sleep  quality,  activity  patterns,  and
relationships  between  these  measures  are  deﬁned  and  quantiﬁed.
These  measures  have  shown  promising  potential  for  answering
both  practical  questions  of  wearable  device  users,  such  as  how
much  sleep  is  needed  for  a  given  individual,  when  is  sleep  debt
accumulating  over  time,  how  do  activity  levels  impact  sleep
quality,  and  open  research  questions  about  how  to  deﬁne  what
behavioral  guidelines  are  most  applicable  for  a  given  individual,
how  to  measure  when  lifestyle  choices  are  impacting  biological
health,  and  how  does  allostatic  load  accumulate  over  time  [4,5].

2.  Background

For  comparing  sleep  performance,  both  the  quantity  and  quality
of  sleep  should  be  objectively  measured.  Astronauts  on  the  ISS
sleep  on  average  about  6  hours  per  night  which  is  less  than  is
typical  on  Earth,  and  astronauts  have  been  shown  to  have  circadian
misalignment  while  in  space  that  is  correlated  to  lower  perceived
sleep  quality  [6,7].  Sleep  quality  reporting  has  been  shown  to  be
more  related  to  sleepiness  than  sleep  duration  [8].  Rather  than
relying  on  subjective  assessments  of  perceived  sleep  quality,  this
research  aims  to  develop  objective  sleep  quality  measures  from
wearables  data  for  analyzing  patterns  of  sleep  and  wakefulness
during  the  night.

With  Jawbone  devices,  sleep  phases  are  deﬁned  as:  deep  sleep
(D),  light  sleep  (L),  and  awakening  (A).  In  addition,  Jawbone  has  a
proprietary  algorithm  for  computing  a  quality  score  for  each  sleep
event.  With  the  proprietary  Jawbone  quality  score,  longer  duration
sleeps  tend  to  receive  high  quality  scores,  and  short  duration
sleeps,  even  if  they  are  entirely  deep  sleep,  still  receive  low  quality
scores.  Intuitively,  it  seems  that  a  sleep  session  that  has  primarily
deep  sleep  and  is  without  awakenings  should  be  scored  as  high
quality;  furthermore,  research  has  shown  that  perceived  sleep
quality  is  not  correlated  with  sleep  duration  [8].  However,  as
shown  in  Fig.  1,  the  Jawbone 
  score  is  93%  correlated  with
sleep 
  or  sleep  duration.  There  is  a  need  for  sleep  quality
measures  that  differentiate  various  patterns  of  sleep  and  are  not
based  solely  on  quantity.

“quantity,”

“quality”

The  sleep  quality  score  presented  here  is  a  weighted  sum  of
sleep  phase  durations  with  a  novel  method  of  assigning  penalties
for  awakenings  during  the  night  (Table  1  and  Fig.  2).  Sleep
measures  in  the  literature  include  sleep  onset,  wake  after  sleep

Fig.  1.  Jawbone  sleep  quality  score  is  highly  correlated  with  sleep  duration.

Fig.  2.  Phases  of  sleep  are  weighted  differently  to  reward  for  deep  sleep  and  light
sleep  and  to  penalize  for  awakenings.  Deep  sleep  phases  are  assigned  a  weight  of  2,
light  sleep  phases  are  assigned  a  weight  of  1,  and  awakenings  are  assigned  from

onset,  fragmentation  or  movement  index,  and  sleep  efﬁciency  [9].
In  brief,  these  measures  quantify  the  amount  of  awake  time  before
falling  asleep  and  the  amount  of  awake  time  versus  the  amount  of
sleep  time  during  the  sleep  event.  For  example,  sleep  efﬁciency  is
the  percentage  of  the  time  spent  in  bed  in  which  the  individual  was
actually  sleeping.  This  quantitative  measure  does  not  consider  how
awakenings  are 
impacting  subsequent  phases  of  sleep.  For
example,  being  awake  for  six  10-min  intervals  during  the  night
will  be  scored  the  same  sleep  efﬁciency  as  being  awake  for  one  60-
min  interval;  these  are  two  qualitatively  different  sleep  experi-
ences  that  the  novel  measure  presented  here  is  able  to  differenti-
ate.

Similarly,  the  movement  index  is  a  count  on  the  number  of
minutes  in  which  one  or  more  movements  were  recorded  (i.e.  the
duration,  or  quantity  of  awakenings,  not  the  pattern  of  awakenings
or  their  impact  on  sleep  quality).  The  fragmentation  index  (FI)  is
computed  by  counting  the  number  of  very  short  time  periods  of
sleep,  such  as  periods  lasting  less  than  1-min,  and  dividing  this
count  by  the  total  number  of  sleep  periods  of  any  duration.  FI
computes  the  proportion  of  sleep  that  was  disturbed  by  brief
awakenings,  but  it  does  not  measure  if  various  awakenings  are
more  or  less  disruptive.

The  participants  in  this  study  were  living  and  working  together
in  an  8-month  simulated  Mars  mission  called  HI-SEAS  (Hawaii
Space  Exploration  Analog  and  Simulation).  HI-SEAS  is  a  University
of  Hawaii  NASA-funded  study  characterizing  the  behavioral  health
and  performance  (BHP)  risks  for  long-duration  human  spaceﬂight
missions.  This  research 
in
accordance  with  University  of  Hawaii  and  NASA  Institutional
Review  Board  approved  protocols  for  human  subject  research.  This
8-month  HI-SEAS  mission  III  began  on  October  15,  2014  and  ended
June  12,  2015.  In  brief,  HI-SEAS  immerses  6-person 
“astronaut-
like”
  crews  in  a  Mars-like  habitat  on  Mauna  Loa  volcano,  isolated
from  the  rest  of  humanity  for  a  long  duration,  conﬁned  to  a  1000-

4.  Theory/calculations

To  compute  a  sleep  quality  score  that  differentiates  the  variable
impact  of  sleep  disturbances,  or  awakenings,  this  research  has
developed  a  novel  approach  of  applying  awakening  penalties.
Consider  that  the  simplest  and  best  case  for  a  night  of  sleep  would
be  if  a  person  could  have  an  entire  night  of  deep  sleep  with  no
awakenings,  and  the  worst  case  would  be  if  a  person  remained
awake  for  the  entire  night.  In  between  these  extreme  cases  are
sleeps  that  have  intermittent  disturbances.  In  order  to  analyze
relationships  between  the  proposed  sleep  quality  score,  other
behavioral  measures,  such  as  length  of  day,  sleep  debt,  sleep  onset,
and  activity  score  have  been  deﬁned  and  computed  as  described  in
sub-sections  4.1–4.7.

4.1.  Sleep  quality  score

The  sleep  quality  score  presented  here  is  a  weighted  sum  of
sleep  phase  durations  with  a  novel  method  of  assigning  penalties
for  awakenings  during  the  night.  Wearable  devices  usually  record
various  types  of  sleep  phases.  With  Jawbone  devices,  these  are
deﬁned  as:  deep  sleep  (D),  light  sleep  (L),  and  awakening  (A).  More
deep  sleep  during  the  night  and  fewer  awakenings  is  considered  as
high  sleep  quality  [10].  Therefore,  the  quality  score  (QS)  for  sleep  s
is  deﬁned  as  a  weighted  sum  with  deep  sleep  phase  durations
having  the  highest  weight  of  2,  light  sleep  having  a  weight  of  1,  and
awakenings  are  assigned  negative  weights  or  penalties  ranging

During  the  8-month  mission,  wrist-\nworn  wearables  were  implemented  for  recording  sleep,  activity,\nand  heart  rate  data  on  a  minute-by-minute  basis.,  These  data  have\n\n\fJ.

As  currently\nplanned,  a  mission  to  Mars  will  be  a  3-year  journey  for  a  small  crew\nof  4-6  astronauts  who  will  need  to  be  resilient  to  the  stressors  of\nisolated  and  con\ufb01ned  living  conditions  in  a  highly  complex  work\nenvironment  [1].  Remote  health  monitoring  has  useful  applica-\ntions  for  astronauts  on  a  mission  to  Mars,  but  also  for  many  other\nhealth  and  performance  applications,  including  at-home  patient\ncare,  athletic  training,  and  military  deployments.  Wearables,\nmobile  applications,  and  telehealth  systems  enable  examinations\nof  health  to  extend  beyond  intermittent  visits  with  coaches  and\nmedical  professionals.  Wearables  data  can  be  transferred  to\nhealthcare  providers  or  other  leaders  and  coaches  as  an  automated,\nreliable  method  for  gaining  information  about  behavioral  patterns\nthat  re\ufb02ect  lifestyle  choices  and  health  status,  and  wearable  users\ncan  receive  interpretations  of  these  data  as  well  as  reminders  and\nincentives  for  continuing  treatment  plans  or  practice  regimens  to\npromote  behavioral  health  changes  and  improved  performance.\nOther  uses  of  behavioral  monitoring  with  wearables  may  include\nhealth  education,  parenting  and  care-taking  in  families,  as  well  as\npersonal  challenges  to  incentivize  sleep  hygiene  and  consistent\nexercise,  including  competitions  among  coworkers,  friends,  and\nfamily.\n\nBy  recording  sleep  and  activity  data,  wearables  are  collecting\nvolumes  of  information  about  users.  However,  in  the  research\ncommunity,  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  accuracy  of  consumer-\ngrade,  wrist-worn  wearables  for  activity,  sleep,  and  heart  rate\nmeasurement.  Consumer-grade  devices  have  not  reached  a  level  of\nacceptability  to  replace  gold-standard  research  methods,  such  as\npolysomnography;  however,  collecting  data  about  a  large  popula-\ntion  offers \n  value,  as  it  is  estimated  that  over  60  million\npeople  in  the  United  States  are  using  consumer-grade  wearables,\nsuch  as  Jawbone  and  Fitbit  wristbands  [2].  Although  consumer-\ngrade,  wrist-worn  wearables  data  are  less  accurate  than  clinical\nresearch  tools  for  sleep  analysis,  this  research  is  leveraging  the\nhigh  volume  of  data  collected  from  these  devices  to  analyze\nchanges  over  time  [3].\n\n\u201cbig  data\u201d\n\nHere,  concepts  of  sleep  debt,  sleep  quality,  activity  patterns,  and\nrelationships  between  these  measures  are  de\ufb01ned  and  quanti\ufb01ed.\nThese  measures  have  shown  promising  potential  for  answering\nboth  practical  questions  of  wearable  device  users,  such  as  how\nmuch  sleep  is  needed  for  a  given  individual,  when  is  sleep  debt\naccumulating  over  time,  how  do  activity  levels  impact  sleep\nquality,  and  open  research  questions  about  how  to  de\ufb01ne  what\nbehavioral  guidelines  are  most  applicable  for  a  given  individual,\nhow  to  measure  when  lifestyle  choices  are  impacting  biological\nhealth,  and  how  does  allostatic  load  accumulate  over  time  [4,5].\n\n2.  Background\n\nFor  comparing  sleep  performance,  both  the  quantity  and  quality\nof  sleep  should  be  objectively  measured.  Astronauts  on  the  ISS\nsleep  on  average  about  6  hours  per  night  which  is  less  than  is\ntypical  on  Earth,  and  astronauts  have  been  shown  to  have  circadian\nmisalignment  while  in  space  that  is  correlated  to  lower  perceived\nsleep  quality  [6,7].  Sleep  quality  reporting  has  been  shown  to  be\nmore  related  to  sleepiness  than  sleep  duration  [8].  Rather  than\nrelying  on  subjective  assessments  of  perceived  sleep  quality,  this\nresearch  aims  to  develop  objective  sleep  quality  measures  from\nwearables  data  for  analyzing  patterns  of  sleep  and  wakefulness\nduring  the  night.\n\nWith  Jawbone  devices,  sleep  phases  are  de\ufb01ned  as:  deep  sleep\n(D),  light  sleep  (L),  and  awakening  (A).  In  addition,  Jawbone  has  a\nproprietary  algorithm  for  computing  a  quality  score  for  each  sleep\nevent.  With  the  proprietary  Jawbone  quality  score,  longer  duration\nsleeps  tend  to  receive  high  quality  scores,  and  short  duration\nsleeps,  even  if  they  are  entirely  deep  sleep,  still  receive  low  quality\nscores.  Intuitively,  it  seems  that  a  sleep  session  that  has  primarily\ndeep  sleep  and  is  without  awakenings  should  be  scored  as  high\nquality;  furthermore,  research  has  shown  that  perceived  sleep\nquality  is  not  correlated  with  sleep  duration  [8].  However,  as\nshown  in  Fig.  1,  the  Jawbone \n  score  is  93%  correlated  with\nsleep \n  or  sleep  duration.  There  is  a  need  for  sleep  quality\nmeasures  that  differentiate  various  patterns  of  sleep  and  are  not\nbased  solely  on  quantity.\n\n\u201cquantity,\u201d\n\n\u201cquality\u201d\n\nThe  sleep  quality  score  presented  here  is  a  weighted  sum  of\nsleep  phase  durations  with  a  novel  method  of  assigning  penalties\nfor  awakenings  during  the  night  (Table  1  and  Fig.  2).  Sleep\nmeasures  in  the  literature  include  sleep  onset,  wake  after  sleep\n\nFig.  1.  Jawbone  sleep  quality  score  is  highly  correlated  with  sleep  duration.\n\n\f34 \n\nJ.  Dunn  et  al.  \/  Computers  in  Industry  92  (2017)  32\u201342\n\nTable  1\nWeights  Wp for  sleep  phase  types  P \n\n2\n\n\u00bd\n  D;\n\n \n\n\u008a:.\n\n  L;\n\n  A\n\nSleep  Phase  Types  (P): \n\nD  for  Deep  sleep  L  for  Light  sleep  A  for  Awakening\n\nWeights  (WP): \n\nWD =  2 \n\nWL =  1 \n\nWA2[-1,0]\n\nFig.  2.  Phases  of  sleep  are  weighted  differently  to  reward  for  deep  sleep  and  light\nsleep  and  to  penalize  for  awakenings.  Deep  sleep  phases  are  assigned  a  weight  of  2,\nlight  sleep  phases  are  assigned  a  weight  of  1,  and  awakenings  are  assigned  from\n[-1,0]  by  a  penalty  function.\n\nonset,  fragmentation  or  movement  index,  and  sleep  ef\ufb01ciency  [9].\nIn  brief,  these  measures  quantify  the  amount  of  awake  time  before\nfalling  asleep  and  the  amount  of  awake  time  versus  the  amount  of\nsleep  time  during  the  sleep  event.  For  example,  sleep  ef\ufb01ciency  is\nthe  percentage  of  the  time  spent  in  bed  in  which  the  individual  was\nactually  sleeping.  This  quantitative  measure  does  not  consider  how\nawakenings  are \nimpacting  subsequent  phases  of  sleep.  For\nexample,  being  awake  for  six  10-min  intervals  during  the  night\nwill  be  scored  the  same  sleep  ef\ufb01ciency  as  being  awake  for  one  60-\nmin  interval;  these  are  two  qualitatively  different  sleep  experi-\nences  that  the  novel  measure  presented  here  is  able  to  differenti-\nate.\n\nSimilarly,  the  movement  index  is  a  count  on  the  number  of\nminutes  in  which  one  or  more  movements  were  recorded  (i.e.  the\nduration,  or  quantity  of  awakenings,  not  the  pattern  of  awakenings\nor  their  impact  on  sleep  quality).  The  fragmentation  index  (FI)  is\ncomputed  by  counting  the  number  of  very  short  time  periods  of\nsleep,  such  as  periods  lasting  less  than  1-min,  and  dividing  this\ncount  by  the  total  number  of  sleep  periods  of  any  duration.  FI\ncomputes  the  proportion  of  sleep  that  was  disturbed  by  brief\nawakenings,  but  it  does  not  measure  if  various  awakenings  are\nmore  or  less  disruptive.\n\n3.  Methods\n\nis  being  conducted  at  HI-SEAS \n\nThe  participants  in  this  study  were  living  and  working  together\nin  an  8-month  simulated  Mars  mission  called  HI-SEAS  (Hawaii\nSpace  Exploration  Analog  and  Simulation).  HI-SEAS  is  a  University\nof  Hawaii  NASA-funded  study  characterizing  the  behavioral  health\nand  performance  (BHP)  risks  for  long-duration  human  space\ufb02ight\nmissions.  This  research \nin\naccordance  with  University  of  Hawaii  and  NASA  Institutional\nReview  Board  approved  protocols  for  human  subject  research.  This\n8-month  HI-SEAS  mission  III  began  on  October  15,  2014  and  ended\nJune  12,  2015.  In  brief,  HI-SEAS  immerses  6-person \n\u201castronaut-\nlike\u201d\n  crews  in  a  Mars-like  habitat  on  Mauna  Loa  volcano,  isolated\nfrom  the  rest  of  humanity  for  a  long  duration,  con\ufb01ned  to  a  1000-\nsquare-foot  living  space,  except  for  spacewalks  wearing  mock\nspacesuits,  while \nfood\nresources,  and  working  with  a  20-min  lag-time  on  all  communi-\ncations  to  and  from  the  habitat.  For  statistical  analysis  of  these\ndata,  we  used  mixed  effects  modeling  and  analysis  of  variance\n\nlimited  energy,  water,  and \n\nliving  on \n\n(ANOVA)  where  participants  are  a \n  factor  and  day  of  week\nor  month  of  mission  are \n\ufb01xed  factors.  Tukey  post-hoc  tests  for\ncomparing  means  were  conducted  with  Bonferroni  adjustment  for\nmultiple  comparisons.\n\n\u201crandom\u201d\n\n4.  Theory\/calculations\n\nTo  compute  a  sleep  quality  score  that  differentiates  the  variable\nimpact  of  sleep  disturbances,  or  awakenings,  this  research  has\ndeveloped  a  novel  approach  of  applying  awakening  penalties.\nConsider  that  the  simplest  and  best  case  for  a  night  of  sleep  would\nbe  if  a  person  could  have  an  entire  night  of  deep  sleep  with  no\nawakenings,  and  the  worst  case  would  be  if  a  person  remained\nawake  for  the  entire  night.  In  between  these  extreme  cases  are\nsleeps  that  have  intermittent  disturbances.  In  order  to  analyze\nrelationships  between  the  proposed  sleep  quality  score,  other\nbehavioral  measures,  such  as  length  of  day,  sleep  debt,  sleep  onset,\nand  activity  score  have  been  de\ufb01ned  and  computed  as  described  in\nsub-sections  4.1\u20134.7.\n\n4.1.  Sleep  quality  score\n\nThe  sleep  quality  score  presented  here  is  a  weighted  sum  of\nsleep  phase  durations  with  a  novel  method  of  assigning  penalties\nfor  awakenings  during  the  night.  Wearable  devices  usually  record\nvarious  types  of  sleep  phases.  With  Jawbone  devices,  these  are\nde\ufb01ned  as:  deep  sleep  (D),  light  sleep  (L),  and  awakening  (A).  More\ndeep  sleep  during  the  night  and  fewer  awakenings  is  considered  as\nhigh  sleep  quality  [10].  Therefore,  the  quality  score  (QS)  for  sleep  s\nis  de\ufb01ned  as  a  weighted  sum  with  deep  sleep  phase  durations\nhaving  the  highest  weight  of  2,  light  sleep  having  a  weight

Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate the design and use of a foresight support sys-
tem (FSS) combining two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Tradi-
tionally, foresight activities involves Delphi, focus group, or Estimate–Talk–Estimate
techniques to collect opinions of an expert panel. Often, these techniques are not com-
puterized and data visualization is rudimentary. Our highly-interactive FSS solves a
number of inherent issues during the data collection, analysis, and results visualiza-
tion processes. Despite that MCDM methods have been recommended for technology
foresight, a validation with a real ﬁeld experiment was still required. To evaluate our
approach and FSS, we conducted a foresight exercise for the Swiss mobile payments
market. Our research conﬁrms that the use of MCDM methods supported with a com-
puterized tool can enhance the foresight processes and results.

One critical issue in IT management is to face emerging technologies (McKeen and
Smith 2003). This challenge requires to adopt a systematic process to stay up-to-date
and evaluate new technology for a potential integration within the organization to
yield economical beneﬁts (Martin 1995). Firms have to assess their environment to
understand the external forces of change that may affect their future position so that
they can develop effective responses (Aguilar 1967). The importance of obtaining a
holistic perception of the environment has been advocated by numerous prominent
authors in the strategic management discipline (e.g., Bourgeois 1980; Learned et al.
1969; Porter 1998). They see co-alignment between the ﬁrm and its environment to
be essential for performance.

The assessment of future technology evolutions and discovery of weak signals
traditionally relies on various forecasting approaches. Often, these approaches use
trends extrapolation. Unfortunately, these approaches are only appropriate when the
uncertainty level is sufﬁciently low (Courtney et al. 1997). Moreover, they fail to
consider the possibility that actors in a system could inﬂuence the evolution of their
own environments, thus causing possible discontinuities with the past (Godet 1979).
In contrast, popular scenario approaches have been conceived to address high levels
of complexity and uncertainty (Dyson 1990). However, they are often difﬁcult to
coordinate given the lack of precise methodology and supporting tools (Salo and
Gustafsson 2004).

In common settings, a panel of experts is formed to discuss possible future trends.
To structure discussions and analyses, the group generally recourses to techniques
such as Delphi (Linstone and Turoff 1975), focus group (Basch 1987), and Estimate–
Talk–Estimate (Gustafson et al. 1973). A weakness of these qualitative techniques
is the poor support of computer-based tools. The data collection, analysis, and out-
come visualization processes are rather limited as the scalability of these methods is
insufﬁcient to integrate large quantity of data. Because of the inherent nature of the
technology foresight process, there are a relatively high number of parameters to con-
sider in order to obtain a more complete picture of the situation. Other management
tools and techniques have been proposed in the scientiﬁc community and the litera-
ture (e.g., scenario planning, technology roadmap, ROI, real option) but few of them
have been widely adopted by companies (Danese and Kalchschmidt 2011; Zotteri and
Kalchschmidt 2007). In many cases, it seems that there is a real lack of interactive
and visualization tools for technology foresight activities (Kuesters et al. 2006; Bañuls
and Salmeron 2011). More emphasis has been given to organizational matters than
the instrumental aspects (Bañuls and Salmeron 2011; Salo et al. 2003).

This paper demonstrates a way to enhance technology foresight processes using
two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods supported by a computerized
tool. In this study, we present the design of a group decision support systems (GDSS)
which aims at facilitating foresight processes. Researchers recently referred to these
systems as foresight support systems (FSS) (Bañuls and Salmeron 2011; Markmann
et al. 2012). Our FSS was designed in order to support data collection, computa-
tion, and visualization. It combines two complementary MCDM methods: ELECTRE
I (Benayoun et al. 1966) and the Weight Sum Model (Fishburn 1967). During the
design process, a special focus has been given to interactivity and visualization. Fol-
lowing the design science research evaluation guidelines provided by Venable et al.

(2012), we evaluated the approach and the tool in a real environment with a number of
industry actors. The ﬁeld study’s objective was to assess and foresight trends for the
Swiss mobile payments market. We identiﬁed two types of possible evolutions: (i) a
technology-based and (ii) an organizational-based. To study these two evolutions, we
involved an exhaustive set of experts working for different industries in Switzerland.
Our research contributes to the extant literature on several fronts. First, although
prior research has claimed that MCDM methods are good candidates for technology
foresight (Salo et al. 2003), they have not been fully explored in real-world settings.
In this study we present an approach combining two complementary MCDM methods
that are suitable for running and improving such exercise. Second, we designed and
tested a FSS to address the scarcity of MCDM computer tools available. Third, we
propose and evaluate nine design propositions to improve the foresight processes with
MCDM methods. Fourth, we introduce new ways of unveiling and visualizing weak
signals with a computer tool. Fifth, we evaluated our design in real settings with
experts dealing with a complex problem at hand (i.e., the development of the Swiss
mobile payment market). Overall, this research extends the MCDM and decision
support systems domains as it provides an original design and a real evaluation for an
alternative application (i.e., technology foresight).

In the next section, we discuss related research and identify some of the issues that
we want to solve with our approach. In Sect. 3, we present our design propositions. To
evaluate the approach, Sect. 4 describes our ﬁeld experiment conducted for the Swiss
mobile payment market. Section 5 discusses some limitations inherent to our research
project. Lastly, Sect. 6 concludes the paper with some discussions and proposes further
research.

2 MCDM Methods for Technology Foresight

To support foresight activities, different methodologies have been proposed. A paper
from the Technology Futures Analysis Methods Working Group (2004) reviews 50
methods that aim at either compiling information or seeking to understand interac-
tions among events, trends, and actions. These methods are either “hard” (quantita-
tive: empirical, numerical) or “soft” (qualitative: judgmentally based, reﬂecting tacit
knowledge). Despite the broad number of methods, common standard practices and
features are shared. In most cases, it is advised to mix both quantitative and quali-
tative approaches. They complement each other well and compensate their possible
weaknesses. Of course, the choice of the method greatly lies on the availability of
the data (Fildes et al. 2006), which explains the multitude of methods available. The
Technology Futures Analysis Methods Working Group (2004) does not prescribe spe-
ciﬁc methods for certain foresight problems. Instead, the group lists a number of
limitations that need to be taken into account when selecting a method. For example,
experts opinion methods are affected by what people perceive as feasible (due to limited
imagination). Quantitative forecasting models sometimes assume linear relationships
among variables while interaction could be multivariate and result in non-lineralities.
Other identiﬁed issues are related to time horizon, degree of complexity, and uncer-
tainty. In the same line, Bendahan et al. (2004) claims that the vast majority of the

123

336

J. Ondrus et al.

methods and techniques proposed are either inappropriate, too complex, or over-
simplistic, hence unusable. Thus they fail to deal appropriately with the rising com-
plexity of the reality they represent. Consequently, methods and tools must be simple
enough to be usable, while being sufﬁciently complex to match as closely as possible
the variety of problems they intend to model.

By deﬁnition MCDM methods are excellent candidates to deal with complex prob-
lems (Petkov et al. 2007). MCDM methods imply a modeling activity, which clariﬁes
many aspects. Salo et al. (2003) claim that MCDM methods offer potential “in terms
of lending rigor and transparency to the foresight process”. Moreover, they argued
that one of MCDM incontestable strengths is the theoretical foundation, which is an
advantage compared to the work that has previously been done in technology foresight.
MCDM methods are largely concerned with the deployment of systematic processes
to help address problems characterized by incomparable objectives, multiple stake-
holders, and conﬂicting interests (Stewart 1992).

MCDM methods are not used to ﬁnd the optimal solution (like a mathematical pro-
gramming model) but rather try to determine what solution is the closest to be “optimal”
in regards of several criteria or among existing solutions. Bui (1984) described two key
features that characterize MCDM methods. First, MCDM methods allow to analyze a
problem with several criteria simultaneously and concurrently. Criteria can be either
quantitative (e.g., cost, weight) or qualitative (e.g., quality of service, beauty). Criteria
usually conﬂict with each other. In other words, the improvement of one criterion can
only be done at the expense of another. Second, MCDM methods allow to consider
experts’ subjective evaluations by letting them express their preferences by evaluating
the alternatives and weighting the criteria.

Roy (2005) explains that the use of MCDM methods is not limited to solving
a problem of choice. He describes four non-exhaustive alternatives. The description
problematic does not seek to elaborate any prescription or recommendation but instead
could just consist of a set of potential actions, a family of criteria and additional
information about the decision problem. The choice problematic aims at selecting the
smallest number of “good” actions that are usually non comparable with one another.
The sorting problematic seeks to assign each action to the most appropriate category.
In this case, the categories are not necessarily ordered. Finally, the ranking problematic
compares actions between one another. Further, he adds that adopting one of them is
in most cases not sufﬁcient to found a prescription or recommendation.

Three distinct phases of the decision have been characterized by Simon (1955).
These are intelligence, design, and choice. Bui (1984) argued that MCDM methods
usually focus on the two last phases. However, MCDM methods have been found in
different ﬁelds of application. Other authors discussed the use of MCDM methods,
such as AHP for making predictions (Bhushan and Rai 2004; Dyer et al. 1988). Yet,
Salo et al. (2003) claims that MCDM methods have not been fully explored in tech-
nology foresight. They justiﬁed this phenomenon because of the recent emergence of
technology foresight activities. Moreover, it seems like more attention in the literature
has been given to organizational matters and less to methodological questions.

In addition to the existing MCDM features, the Technology Futures Analysis Meth-
ods Working Group (2004) argues that a multi-actor approach is desirable for tech-
nology foresight. Multi-actor approaches apply to situations where multiple actors are

123

A Foresight Support System Using MCDM Methods

337

confronted with a number of issues whose the evolution in the future is uncertain and
difﬁcult to foresight (Bendahan et al. 2004). Such situations could be found in contexts
where various actors have different goals or preferences on the different alternatives
under discussion. Another situation is a scenario where actors could play a key role
in the evolution of the current situation by inﬂuencing a number of key evolutionary
variables. To achieve a better understanding of these situations, methods should take
into account the preferences of all relevant actors and the interrelationship between
them (Bendahan et al. 2004).

Another important feature to take into account during foresight activities is the time
dimension. Raﬁi and Kampas (2002)’ instrument is one of the few existing MCDM
framework that was proposed for technology foresight. They introduce a time dimen-
sion (i.e., stages) to take into account the dynamic perspective needed for a technology
foresight exercise. Raﬁi and Kampas intend their simple tool to be used in a situation
where a dominant actor (incumbent) might be threatened by an insurgent but does
not know the real impact. Unfortunately, the use of Raﬁi and Kampas’ instrument has
several weaknesses. The instrument is rather limited for multi-actor usage. Scalability
is therefore particularly hard to achieve. As only two alternatives can be compared at a
time, this technique prevents to conduct a more holistic analysis. In terms of outcome,
the evaluation is superﬁcial and needs ﬁner granularity to fully grasp the phenomenon
studied. In brief, Raﬁi and Kampas framework is only suitable for getting an overview
of a given situation. More precise data and outcome are required to better understand
complex problems.

Despite Salo et al. (2003)’ claim and our arguments that MCDM methods are good
candidates for technology foresight activities, a demonstration and validation in real
settings are still required. In the next sections, we propose the design and use of an
integrated MCDM approach supported by a FSS that aims at increasing the efﬁciency
and effectiveness of technology foresight activities as it simpliﬁes and streamlines the
data collection, computing, and visualization processes.

3 Design Propositions: Towards an Integrated Multi-perspective Approach

In this section, we elaborate nine implementable design propositions to enhance tech-
nology foresight activities. The main objective is to fulﬁll the multi-criteria, multi-
actor, and multi-stage dimensions requirements. Using a MCDM process view to
illustrate MCDM methods (Bui 1984), we structure our propositions with the tra-
ditional Input–Tool–Output relation (see Table 1). Our design propositions aim at
aligning our design to this process and enabling computer-support for each stage of it.

The INPUT comprises three important components: (i) the alternatives, (ii) the
criteria, and (iii) the decision-maker preferences (i.e., the evaluations and weights).
The alternatives are the possible solutions or actions for a particular decision problem.
The criteria are the different aspects under which alternatives can be evaluated. The
preferences are the evaluations of the alternatives under a criterion. The weights are
the relative importances or priorities of the criteria for the decision-maker.

The TOOL (computation) is the collection of methodologies the analyst needs in
order to use MCDM methods. The methodologies can be very formalized or heuristic
depending on the type of problem to solve.

The OUTPUT are the results obtained by the MCDM methods. This results are
usually synthetic and could be represented in varied forms such as rankings, zero-one
matrices and graphs.

3.1 INPUT: Facilitating the Experts’ Preference Elicitation

The formulation of alternatives belong to the ﬁrst step when building an MCDM model.
Often, alternatives are established by a subset of experts. The selected alternatives are
then ﬁxed in the model and shared among all experts. Next, experts choose a set
of criteria to evaluate the alternatives. The relative weight of each criterion is also
established in order to take into account how important the experts judge the criterion
to be. When the initial MCDM model is built, the data collection process can begin
with the elicitation of experts’ preferences. In other words, the experts evaluate each
alternative for each criterion.

During this INPUT process, several problems have to be ﬁxed. Depending on the
number of alternatives and criteria, MCDM methods could require to collect a rather
large amount of data from the expert. As a result, the process becomes quite repetitive.
During a ﬁeld experiment, the time granted by the experts (e.g., executives) is usu-
ally short. Experts can become impatient with a repetitive input method. The tedious
process for preference elicitation has to be quick and enjoyable. Second, in a fore-
sight process the number of experts involved can be large. The classic data collection
processes for MCDM methods need to be scalable. Third, the preference elicitation
can happen in different settings. For example, experts can be met individually in a
sequence or all simultaneously in the same room. The data collection methods have
to offer some versatility.

In order to solve the three exposed problems in the INPUT process, we describe three
design propositions. First, we propose to computerize the data collection and make
the process quicker and more enjoyable. Second, we suggest to enable the possibility
to integrate as many individual MCDM models as required. Third, we recommend
adequate options to enter evaluations into the individual MCDM models.

3.1.1 Design Proposition I: Computerized Tool for Facilitating the Data Collection

To avoid collecting data with a repetitive survey, the use of the “Pack of Cards”
technique proposed by Simos (1990), later improved by Pictet and Bollinger (2003),
can ease and speed up the MCDM data collection process. Cards of each criterion and

alternatives are given to experts. Experts are allowed to add or remove any criterion at
the beginning of the process. Once the set of criteria is deﬁned, experts rank criteria in
order of importance to derive the weights. The next step is to group and rank alternatives
for each criterion. Finally, experts assign an evaluation (e.g., weak, fair, average, good,
excellent) to the different groups of alternatives. In addition to the improved efﬁciency
of the process, the active participation in the procedure gives experts a more intuitive
understanding of the approach (Rogers et al. 2000).

Due to the more enjoyable data collection process, we propose to adopt the manual
“Pack of Cards” technique as well as some improvements (see Fig. 1). The weights are
calculated automatically in real-time by the computer once the ranking is done. Then,
sequentially, experts evaluate alternatives in light of the criteria by using the verbal
scale varying from weak, fair, average, good to excellent. Once the evaluation step is
done, the software automatically enters data in the MCDM model and computes the
results. There is no manual input required.

To display the evaluations of the alternatives, the criteria, and their respective
weights, an editable matrix contains all the data collected (see Fig. 2). The criteria are
listed in the ﬁrst column in the left, sorted by importance (weight). The second column
contains the weight given to each criterion. The total weight of 100 has to be spread
among all the criteria. The ﬁrst row lists the alternatives. Then, at the intersections of
rows and columns, we ﬁnd the scores (i.e., evaluations, preferences). The evaluations
are based on a ﬁve-value scale (i.e., weak, fair, average, good, excellent). Each value is
represented by a different shape and color. The different shapes are helpful for “black
and white” printing and color-blind people.

3.1.2 Design Proposition II: Support Scalability to Include as Many Experts

as Needed

As technology foresight activities calls for the participation of multiple actors, our
approach should allow to collect data from numerous experts for the same analysis.

123

340

J. Ondrus et al.

Fig. 2 Data input matrix

The tool should support data collection as well as data modiﬁcation for each expert.
The scalability of the tool is important as any additional MCDM model added in the
overall analysis could provide interesting insights.

3.1.3 Design Proposition III: Allow Flexibility to Use in Different Settings

The data collection process could be done in asynchronous (individual meetings) or
synchronous (experts workshop) manners. The “Pack of Card” technique is well-suited
for face-to-face data collection for the creation of one single MCDM model. When
meeting experts sequentially, the “Pack of Card” technique is an appropriate option.
The interviewer is guiding the interviewee while playing with the cards. If a group
of experts from different companies gather to work together in one location, another
input mechanism should be used. The interviewer has to be able to manually enter the
data using a graphical interface or upload a simple formatted text ﬁle.

3.2 TOOL: Real-time Computing for Quicker Feedback and Re-evaluation

Possibility

When the data collection process is ﬁnished, experts tend to ask for real-time feedback
of their results. They are eager to know how they compare to the rest of the group. In
order to satisfy their desire, the interviewer should be able to compute and aggregate
the data directly. A quick feedback from the tool also allows experts to revise the
data input if errors have been made. Having interactions between the interviewer and
interviewee right after the data computation makes discussions about the results much
richer.

Experts should be able to interpret the results obtained with the MCDM methods
selected. These methods should be simple enough for experts to understand how results
are related to the data collected. Moreover, the selected methods should allow a certain
degree of aggregation as to enable a group MCDM model based on all individual
models. Finally, if changes have to be made after computing the data, the tool should
support data updates. A robustness analysis is also welcome in order to indicate to the
experts which evaluation is more likely to be changed, either because of an error or a
misunderstanding.

3.2.1 Design Proposition IV: Combining Complementary MCDM Methods

In line with the problem at hand, we reviewed advantages and drawbacks of several
MCDM methods. Our choice was based on two main constraints: (i) the data col-
lection requirements (i.e., easy and fast) and (ii) computation algorithms (i.e., simple
and understandable for participants). We selected ELECTRE I (Benayoun et al. 1966)
and the weighted sum model (WSM) (Fishburn 1967), as the set of data required
to run the computation of both methods is compatible. ELECTRE I comes from the
family of the “outranking methods”, while the WSM enables the computation of a
ranking of the best alternatives based on the preferences collected. The computa-
tion of both methods is simple enough for the experts to understand how results are
obtained.

ELECTRE I gives the possibility to model a decision making process by using the
concordance and discordance indexes and the outranking relations. The concordance
index measures the degree of dominance of one action over another, based on the rel-
ative importance weightings of the decision criteria. The discordance index measures
the degree to which an action is worse than another. In summary, concordance and
discordance indices can be viewed as measurements of satisfaction and dissatisfac-
tion that a decision maker senses when choosing one action over another. In other
words, ELECTRE I reveals the ideal alternatives with a maximum of advantages and
a minimum of inconveniences in the function of various criteria.

To present the algorithm used for ELECTRE I, we propose a pair of alternatives
“a” and “b”. Each criterion is assigned a weight w j (j = 1, n; n = number of criteria).
The concordance index is deﬁned as follows:

ca,b = 1
W

(cid:2)

w j

∀ j: g j (a)≥g j (b)

where W = (cid:3)

n
j=1

w j and g j (a) is the score for technology a under criterion j.

The discordance index is deﬁned as follows:

Otherwise,

da,b = 0 if g j (a) ≥ g j (b) ∀ j

da,b = max

j

(cid:4)

g j (b) − g j (a)

(cid:5)

δ j

(1)

(2)

(3)

where δ j is the range of the scale associated with the criterion j.

Both index values are then compared with the respective threshold (sc and sd )
to determine their signiﬁcance. A concordance and discordance value are considered
signiﬁcant if

ca,b ≥ sc
da,b < sd

123

342

J. Ondrus et al.

The outranking relation ra,b is deﬁned as:

ra,b =

(cid:6)

1 if ca,b ≥ sc and da,b < sd
0 otherwise

(4)

The result of ELECTRE I is an outranking graph or matrix which will display which

alternative is signiﬁcantly preferred over another one.

On the other side, the WSM produces a ranking of alternatives. The basic logic
is to compute a weighted sum of the evaluations of each alternative over all criteria.
The greater the weighted sum the more preferred the alternative (Fishburn 1967). The
WSM score (S) for the alternatives (i) is deﬁned as follows:

Si = n(cid:2)
j=1

ei j w j ,

for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , m.

(5)

where ei j is the evaluation of the alternative i for criterion j, and w j is the weight of
criterion j.

3.2.2 Design proposition V: Aggregation of Individual Results for Group Analysis

In order to identify a possible consensus between the experts, we suggest the addition
of a group decision feature to our algorithm. Bui and Jarke (1984) have previously
proposed a method based on ELECTRE I for group decision making. They suggested
applying the min–max concept of game theory (Neumann and Morgenstern 1953). To
reach a consensus, this method takes the most severe technology evaluations for each
criteria done by any actor (n is the number of actors). The group concordance (cG
a,b)
and discordance (d G

a,b) indices could be deﬁned as:

= min
= max

cG
a,b
d G
a,b

(cid:7)
cau ,bu
(cid:7)
dau ,bu

(cid:8)
| u = 1, . . . , n
(cid:8)
| u = 1, . . . , n

(6)

(7)

and the group concordance ( pG) and discordance (q G) thresholds can be respectively
computed as follows:

pG = max [ pu | u = 1, . . . , n]
q G = min [qu | u = 1, . . . , n]

(8)
(9)

where pu is the concordance and qu is the discordance thresholds for each actor u.
For the WSM, we also added a group feature in the algorithm. The group score (G)
for the alternative (i) is deﬁned as follows:

Gi = o(cid:2)
k=1

n(cid:2)
j=1

ei jk w jk ,

fori = 1, 2, 3, . . . , m.

(10)

where ei jk is the evaluation of the alternative i for criterion j by the expert k, and w j k
is the weight of criterion j by expert k.

3.2.3 Design Proposition VI: Compute Data Realtime for Instant Feedback

As stated above, the tool should allow realtime computation in order to give quick
feedback to the experts. After individual evaluations are added to the model, experts
can revise their preferences if they feel that they made a mistake. Through the whole
data collection and computation process, the data collector can interact with the experts
to answer questions or concerns for instance. This feature aims at limiting the input
of errors in the model. As opposed to other tools tested, the main screen displays both
the data collected and the results at once (see Fig. 3). The tool computes ELECTRE
I results either on demand or continuously (by clicking on the corresponding buttons
located in the toolbar or selecting an option from the menu). This option enables a
“what if” sensitivity analysis capability as by giving instantaneous feedback for any
changes made in the data matrix. This module helps to evaluate the stability of the
analysis and supports an exploration of alternative scenarios.

In some cases, an experts hesitates about a particular evaluation. For instance, in
Fig. 4, the expert evaluated the alternative 2 on criterion 2 as “excellent”. If the expert
hesitates with “good” or “average”, the tool indicates that the change would not matter,
as it would not have an effect on the outranking relations. However, if the expert would
like to change to “fair”, then it will have an impact on the overall analysis. Computing

Fig. 4 Individual robustness analysis

the robustness of a single evaluation is quite practical when reﬁning the analysis for a
given expert.

The Individual Robustness Analysis automatically computes all of the limits (i.e.,
purple zone on the arrow) within which the experts can change evaluations without
changing the overall result of the analysis. The matrix gives an instant overview of
evaluations and their impact on the outcome. This matrix can help to compare the
position of a selected actor with the average evaluation of the whole group and its
family (if experts are grouped in industries for example). This module is helpful
to detect evaluations that prevent a group consensus. Diverging evaluations could be
opposed opinions, errors, or simply a demonstration of knowledge disparities between
the experts. Sometimes, experts are just more knowledgable about certain alternatives
than others.

3.3 OUTPUT: Improving Visualization of Data and Results to Facilitate

Identiﬁcation of Possible Weak Signals

The output of MCDM methods is often represented in form of matrix or table. Visual-
ization of the data collected and results is limited in most cases. A human intervention
is required in order to draw or represent the data differently. If no speciﬁc visualiza-
tion efforts are made, getting a quick feedback or overview of the data is challenging.
Moreover, the use of a visualization tool would help unveiling patterns and consensus
possibility, especially in presence of a large dataset. In technology foresight, the qual-
ity of the input as well as the clarity of the output are essential for unveiling trends.
Having a colorful and highly-interactive user interface facilitates a more efﬁcient and
effective representation of the data and results. Moreover, the tool should be ﬂexible
enough to allow the creation and storage of different scenarios.

Our tool provides two main types of output. The tool displays the results of the
MCDM models’ computation. Moreover, various visualization modules are available
to compare and scrutinize the data collected from different perspectives. We also
implemented a scenario building feature in order to store different states of analysis.

3.3.1 Design Proposition VII: Support an Effective Visualization of the Results

The visualization of the results of MCDM methods comprises two perspectives: (i)
outranking relations (ELECTRE I) and (ii) a ranking of alternatives (WSM). The
complementarity of the two methods helps to visualize the outcome in two different
manners. The graphical representations can be easily interpreted by experts.

The outranking relations of ELECTRE I are usually obtained with a combination
of a high level of concordance and a low level of discordance. These levels are ﬁxed
by a concordance and discordance threshold which can be seen as severity levels over
and under which an action could outrank another. The results of ELECTRE 1 can be
presented with a matrix containing “1s and 0s” to indicate which alternative outranks
an other. Yet, a better way of visualizing these relations are outranking graphs as they
are easily understandable. In Fig. 5a, alternative 1 outranks alternatives 2, 3 and 5 but
not 4. It means that alternative 1 is signiﬁcantly preferred to 2, 3 and 5 but we cannot
compare it with alternative 4. Moreover, the alternatives that are not outranked belong
to a core which regroups the best solutions. In our case, alternative 1 and 4 belong
to this core. If an arrow is bi-directional, it just means that the two alternative are
equivalent.

The results obtained with WSM are represented in a simple ranking which displays
the score of each alternative (see Fig. 5b). The scale to calculate the scores is predeﬁned
as 1 for weak, 2 for fair, 3 for average, 4 for good, and 5 for excellent.

3.3.2 Design Proposition VIII: Support the Comparison of the Data and Results

Individual experts need to see their own results as well as how they compare to the
group of experts. We developed a number of visualization modules to address this
requirement. In this section, only three modules will be presented as space is limited.
The ﬁrst module gives a quick overview of all the evaluation of the group of experts.

Fig. 6 Comparison of the evaluations and weights

The second module displays the weights given to the criteria by all the experts. The
third module shows all the experts’ evaluations for one selected alternative.

Figure 6 exhibits a quick overview of how much the experts agree on the evalua-
tion of an alternative. All the evaluation of experts are displayed in one large matrix
(background image). Details for each evaluation can be obtained by clicking one of
the small graphs located in the matrix (here criterion 2 for alternative 5). The graphic
is vertically sliced into zones devoted to the evaluation (scale). The height represents
the weight for the criterion (i.e. the higher the position, the more important the crite-
rion is for the expert). In other words, each small icon represents the evaluation and
the weight of an actor. In this graph, an actor is deﬁned by a number and its industry
(different icon and color).

If the color of the graph is uniform, it means that the experts tend to agree. If the
graph looks like a rainbow, it indicates that experts do not agree. The size of the colored
zone is also important as it shows approximately the number of experts who have the
same evaluation (not necessarily the same weight). A large green zone means that the
experts evaluate the alternative as good or excellent for the given criterion. A red or
orange zone stipulates that experts evaluate the alternative as weak or fair.

Figure 7 shows the individual weights of each expert for each criteria in a matrix.
Again, by clicking on the matrix it is possible to zoom on one graph and obtain more
details. This matrix is useful to rapidly observe if experts agree or disagree on the
importance of criteria. An exponential curve shows that the experts do not have the
same priority on the criterion. However, a ﬂat horizontal line means that the criterion
has the same importance for all the experts. An additional feature on this graph is
the possibility to identify the family (industry) each experts belongs to. This helps

to identify industry patterns for the importance of the criterion. In our example, we
observe that expert do not really have the same priorities for criterion 4. The average
weight is “11” (on a 100), while the maximum is “23” and minimum “5”. About
half of the experts are below the average and about half above the average. In this
particular graph, we do not really a pattern for experts coming from the same industry
(family).

We built an additional matrix to get a more precise overview of all the evaluations
done by the experts (Fig. 8). This matrix enables to quickly identify if the evaluations
are good or bad for a given alternative, just by looking at the dominant colors. The
experts are grouped by family (coloring of columns).

Other comparison modules have been developed. Each module has a precise objec-
tive. Either the module provides an overview to quickly identify a trend or allows a
more detailed view, to obtain a precise comparison of selected experts, evaluations, or
criteria.

3.3.3 Design Proposition IX: Allow the Creation and Storage of Alternative

Scenarios

Another essential capability of our tool is the sensitivity analysis feature, which is
impossible to obtain without the help of a dedicated computerized tool. The tool can
simulate changes and indicate which expert, evaluation, or criterion could change the
group consensus. For example, it is possible to simulate an improvement of alternative
1 in terms of criterion 2 and observe the changes in the model in a realtime manner.
We could also insert new alternatives and observe the impacts in a given MCDM

123

348

J. Ondrus et al.

model. For each change made, our tool supports the storage and facilitates browsing
in between models.

In order to conduct the foresight analysis, we ﬁrst establish a model with current
alternatives. This ﬁrst model is used for assessment and benchmarking purposes. Then,
we add a new (future) alternative into the model. The insertion on the additional alter-
native aims at observing the impacts generated within the ﬁrst model. We assume
that the experts do not change their evaluations about former alternatives. If the addi-
tional alternative performs better than the former alternatives, we could consider the
additional alternative as a serious option for future developments.

4 Evaluation of the FSS and Our Design Propositions: Foresight of a Mobile

Payment Situation

In this section, we describe the evaluation of our tool. This stage is considered to be
central and essential for any design science research project (Gregor and Hevner 2013).
The evaluation provides evidence that the designed tool “works” or achieves its purpose
(March and Smith 1995; Venable et al. 2012). The overall utility, quality, and efﬁcacy
of the tool depends on various characteristics such as functionality, completeness,
consistency, accuracy, performance, reliability, usability, and other relevant quality
attributes (Hevner et al. 2004). The objective is not to check each factor one by one
but select the aspects that are the most relevant to assess. Hevner et al. (2004) also
propose different methods for evaluation: (i) observations (e.g., case and ﬁeld studies),
(ii) analyses (e.g., architecture, optimization), (iii) experiments (e.g., simulations), (iv)
tests on the functions and structures, and (v) descriptions (e.g., informed arguments,
scenarios). An evaluation can be a simple demonstration (light-weight evaluation that
shows the utility of the tool at least in one context) or a more formal and extensive
process with a positivistic stance using objective quantitative performance measures
(Peffers et al. 2007). As a conclusion, Venable et al. (2012) explain that despite the
wide number of evaluation methods available, there is little guidance in selecting the
among methods and designing the right evaluation strategy.

To guide the evaluation of our tool ex post, we adopted a framework for design
science research proposed by Venable et al. (2012). Their 2-by-2 framework implies
that an evaluation can be done ex ante and ex post in either naturalistic (i.e., real
people, real systems, real settings (Sun and Kantor 2006) or artiﬁcial environments.
The use of the dimensions presented can be mixed as a design project has several
“build and evaluate” iterations (March and Smith 1995). At the beginning of a design
project, an ex ante evaluation with an artiﬁcial environment might be more appropriate
while the ﬁnal design tool (ex post) should be evaluated in a naturalistic environment
to offer a better validity (Venable et al. 2012).

The tool has been developed through several iterations in order to comply with
the speciﬁcations derived from our design propositions. As a result, we had several
evaluations. During the ﬁrst software development phases, we tested the tool in our
laboratory with a ﬁctitious set of data (i.e., ex ante, artiﬁcial). Once the tool was ready
to be used in real settings, we proceeded with several “build and evaluate” loops (i.e.,
ex post, naturalistic). As we had a real problem to solve with real people, our primary

123

A Foresight Support System Using MCDM Methods

349

objective was to evaluate the utility and effectiveness (i.e., works in real situation) of
our tool to support and facilitate a technology foresight using MCDM methods. Other
factors such as efﬁciency (minimizing resources) and representativity of the results
were also part of the evaluation.

The main evaluation our designed tool (i.e., ﬁeld study) took place in naturalistic
settings with experts with a concrete problem at hand. The mobile payment market
in Switzerland had adequate characteristics to be a good ﬁeld for our evaluation. The
developments of mobile payment have been slow for many years despite numerous
optimistic predictions. The market is characterized by high uncertainty about emerging
alternatives. Moreover, the market is subject to conﬂicting interests of experts working
in different industries. To succeed in this ﬁeld experiment, an essential requirement
was the ability to gather an exhaustive set of representative experts from the differ-
ent companies active in the market. Our objective was to use our designed tool in
order to get a better understanding of the market and detect weak signals of possible
technological and organizational evolutions.

In this evaluation section, we purposely do not emphasize on the actually analysis
of collected and the results obtained during the ﬁeld experiment. A more detailed
analysis can be found in previously published studies which focus speciﬁcally on the
mobile payment issues Ondrus and Pigneur (2007, 2009)

4.1 A Technology Foresight Exercise for the Swiss Mobile Payment Market

As we wanted to better grasp the problem of the Swiss market, we ﬁrst examined
other, more advanced markets to see what types of shift occurred. We looked into the
Japanese and the Hong Kong markets and observed two shifts. In Japan, consumers
could use their mobile phones to make proximity payments. In Hong Kong, the Mass
Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) has been able to launch a very successful scheme
with Octopus. The lesson learned from the Hong Kong experience is that a self-
organized scheme offered by an independent or a consortium of independents (e.g.,
public transportation companies, retailers) could enable a new industrial organization
of the payment market. Based on the two cases, we identiﬁed two possible evolutions
we wanted to study for the Swiss context.

4.1.1 Evolution I: Mobile Phone Payment Schemes Could Threaten the Established

Payment Systems in Switzerland

The ﬁrst potential evolution could a shift from card-based to phone-based solutions.
Today, card-based payment schemes are widely accepted. However, with high market
penetration of mobile phones and the digitalization of the payment process, phone-
based solutions could become an inherent threat for current card-based schemes. We
added money (i.e., cash) for benchmarking purposes. The technology alternatives and
criteria used for this analysis are listed in Table 2.

4.1.2 Evolution II: Payment Systems Provided by Self-organized Actors Could

Threaten the Ones Provided by Operators

The second evolution studied is organization-based (i.e. a switch from a dominant
operator-driven to a more self-organized solution). Financial institutions and MNOs
are dominant actors in the mobile payments market. However, merchants or newcom-
ers could launch independent payment schemes that could compete with the current
ones operated exclusively by ﬁnancial institutions. We wanted to explore the different
industry organizations that could emerge in the Swiss payment market (see Table 3).
The two lists of criteria was extracted from the literature, discussed in focus groups
and validated with several experts. The preselection of criteria was done to facilitate
the work of experts during the interviews. During data collection, each expert could
still add or remove the criteria they considered relevant or irrelevant.

4.2 The Experiment Settings

To fully represent the Swiss mobile payment market, we focused on ﬁve industries
(ﬁnancial institutions, MNOs, retailers, public transportation companies, technology
providers). The 21 companies selected were the major ﬁrms in the Swiss mobile pay-
ment market in 2006. Each company was represented by one to three experts. The
participating experts were the decision-makers and architects of the future develop-
ments in the Swiss payment market. The group was as exhaustive as possible. We
interviewed experts in face-to-face settings (in their premises) using our tool installed

123

A Foresight Support System Using MCDM Methods

351

on a laptop. Due to time constraints, we had to meet some experts several times to
collect the data for both analyses (i.e., technology and organizational). The interviews
usually lasted between one and 2 h.

As we wanted to test our tool in different settings, we also organized a 2-h workshop
with all the experts. The main objective was to evaluate an upcoming alternative [i.e.,
near ﬁeld communication (NFC)]. The ﬁrst part consisted of a presentation of the
previous results (i.e., assessment and benchmark of current alternatives). Then, to
evaluate NFC, we distributed individual paper forms for each expert. These forms
were customized with the criteria previously selected by each expert. We collected
the forms and started to manually enter the evaluations in our tool. After having
inserted and computed the data, we immediately exposed the results to the experts.
This particular setting created the opportunity to evaluate the ability of our proposed
design to collect data, analyze, and discuss the results in a workshop setting gathering
all the experts.

4.3 Evaluation: the Tool Facilitates the Experts’ Preference Elicitation (INPUT)

Our tool clearly improved the data collection process. We were able quickly to collect
data for as many experts as required for the analysis. The repetitive way of collecting
data for MCDM methods is monotonous. Using the tool with the computerized “Pack
of Card” technique ended in a much faster and less painful data collection. Expert
liked the process as it was interactive and convivial. We conducted interviews over a
7-month period. Our tool handled well the ad hoc additions of new experts’ preferences.
Its scalability was tested with more than 20 companies. The navigation between the
different companies’ MCDM models did not cause any problem. Finally, we were able
to test the ﬂexibility of our tool in different settings. We managed to collect data for
one expert, several experts from the same companies (one model) and experts from
various companies at the same time (workshop). In any of the described scenario, the
tool helped us to quickly enter efﬁciently the data into the tool. The evaluation points
are summarized in Fig. 9.

4.4 Evaluation: the Tool Gives Quicker Result Feedback and Re-evaluation

Possibility (TOOL)

Thanks to the nature of the data collected, we could compute data with two MCDM
methods which both provide different outcome. In several cases, we found that com-
bining the two methods helped us to better explain the overall results of one company
or an industry. The group decision feature allowed us to better understand the prefer-
ences of an individual company, a particular industry, or the whole market. Another
essential feature of the tool was the realtime computing. This feature gave instant feed-
back to experts on their results as well as allowed to conduct some sensitivity analysis
for robustness testing of the results obtained. The evaluation points are summarized
in Fig. 10.

The use of ELECTRE I is resulting in outranking graphs which sometimes do not
give much information about which solution is preferred, especially if thresholds are

too severe. In few cases, there were few or no outranking relations displayed. Experts
were frustrated by such outcome. They felt that the time they spent was useless. By
combining ELECTRE I and WSM, we were assured that we could always provide and
comment some results to experts.

The algorithm proposed by Bui and Jarke (1984) worked well in order to obtain a
group outranking graph. The addition of new experts in the group model ﬁtted well.
However, this algorithm had limitations. The more companies we added, the more
likely the group outranking graph would not give any outranking relations. This issue
can easily be explained as there was not a clear consensus in the market. Thus, the
value of the WSM method became clear. We could get a group ranking even if the
companies did not have a consensus.

The realtime computing capability of our tool was appreciated by the experts.
A discussion on the result was possible right after the data collection. This way we
did not have to go back to the experts later. One face-to-face meeting was enough

4.5 Evaluation: the Tool Improves Visualization of Data and Results to Facilitate

Identiﬁcation of Possible Weak Signals (OUTPUT)

We clearly focused the design of our tool on visualization capabilities. The richness
of the data collected could only be exploited with a highly interactive user interface.
The more data we collected, the more the tool showed its power in terms of scalability.
Several modules were only exploitable when we reached a signiﬁcant number of
companies. We found that a major drawback of most tools previously tested was the
visualization of the results and data collected. Moreover, the tool had to support the
addition of new alternatives, new actors, new criteria as well as a “What if” analysis
feature. The validation points are summarized in Fig. 11.

The results obtained by the two MCDM methods were complementary, particularly
when displayed side-by-side. Some existing tools we tested were able to compute
several MCDM methods but had separate windows to display the results. Therefore, it
was difﬁcult to quickly compare the results obtained using several MCDM methods.
Our tool quickly displayed the results, compared to other tools tested. It helped us to
explain and analyze the results in an timely way.

Using the group decision feature, we were able to unveil interesting results that we
would not have discovered without the help of the tool. During our ﬁeld experiment, we
examined the group outranking graph of the three national mobile network operators.
The graph showed that telcos would signiﬁcantly prefer the “F&T” alternative to
“Telco” or “Financial” (Fig. 12). Experts working for the ﬁnancial institutions had
exactly the same preferences. As these two groups of experts seem to agree that
collaboration between them is the preferred alternative, it meant that both groups of
experts were more likely to collaborate instead of competing.

As for the foresight, the creation of a future scenario with NFC was successful. We
added the “NFC” alternative into the model and asked the experts to evaluate it. The

results showed that it performed well (see Fig. 13). It was an interesting discovery
as other mobile phone technology alternatives were underperforming in the previous
model. This result indicated that NFC could be a reasonably good future alternative
for setting up mobile payment systems.

4.6 Evaluation: Feedback from the Experts

In order to evaluate the utility and representability of our results, we interrogated the
experts during and after the research project. We collected both qualitative quotes and
quantitative evaluations of the results we obtained (Fig. 14). One expert expressed
his appreciation for the realistic conclusions we obtained: “One of the rare pieces
of research that represents well the current market”. Another expert commented the
results about his company: “Other companies like to work with us as we are more ﬂex-
ible than our competitors. The model depicts this situation very well”. Another expert
concluded that: “It is interesting that the results show precisely the disagreements
which hindered the development of mobile payments in Switzerland”. Overall, we got
positive feedback from all the experts we re-contacted after the project. Moreover, the
roundtable we organized with most of the experts provided additional validation of

the results with the survey. As can be seen in Fig. 14, the experts mostly agreed with
our results.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a foresight approach using MCDM methods supported
with a computerized tool (FSS). This FSS has been developed according to nine
design propositions in order to enhance technology foresight processes and results.
Not only the tool solved inherent problems of a foresight exercise but also demon-
strated the relevance of adopting MCDM methods for such activity. A foresight process
requires to establish the current situation, identify issues, include relevant stakehold-
ers, and consider various perspectives. Our MCDM approach demonstrated that all
these requirements were addressed.

This design science research project comes with a number of limitations. First, we
used two classic MCDM methods for our tool. We did not develop any new algorithms
that could have been more customized for technology forecasting. Consequently, our
theoretical contribution is mainly on the original use of MCDM methods and not
in the novelty of the methods themselves. Second, we did not try to compare our
integrated and computerized approach with others technology forecasting methods.
The objective was to design a new tool using MCDM methods that would help to better
understand the mobile payment markets using multiple perspectives in a multi-actor
context. Third, at this stage, we can only measure the success of our tool as a feasibility
test of the use of MCDM methods for technology forecasting. Fourth, the tool was
develop and use by us exclusively during the research project. Therefore, we did not
make any usability tests that would conclude that the tool is appropriate for other
users. We paid special attention on the readability of the results by the experts but not
on the ease of use of the user interface. Finally, this project was speciﬁcally tailored
to assess a market such as the mobile payment market. As our design iterations (i.e.,
build-and-evaluate loops) were highly inﬂuenced by the context studied, it is difﬁcult
to evaluate how appropriate the tool would be for other situations.

123

356

J. Ondrus et al.

Despite the limitations, one essential contribution in this paper lies in the use of
MCDM methods, not for decision-making, but for technology assessment and fore-
sight. The use of MCDM methods for technology foresight has been suggested by
Salo et al. (2003), but has not been fully explored in a real environment. Therefore,
this paper contributes to the technology foresight body of knowledge by providing the
design of an original multi-actor multi-criteria approach with an integrated tool.

In terms of the MCDM literature, we also demonstrated the use of different sets of
criteria for each expert. In our case, we involved experts working for different industries
with varying priorities. Each expert had the possibility to use a different set of criteria
to evaluate the same alternatives. Usually, a group of decision-makers use the same
criteria to evaluate the same alternatives. In terms of visualization, we explored the
beneﬁts of comparing side-by-side results obtained by two complementary MCDM
methods in realtime.

As for the managerial implications, there was a real ﬁeld experiment covering a
national market. The foresight exercise on mobile payments in Switzerland involved
experts from more than 20 companies. These experts represented the group of archi-
tects building the future of mobile payments in Switzerland. The results obtained with
the FSS allowed to conﬁrm the current status of the market as well as unveil possible
future evolutions. Moreover, the granularity of the analysis was high enough to reveal
the reasons why mobile phones were still not supported by most experts, especially
from the ﬁnancial industry. It also showed that Telcos should not develop a mobile
payment solution by themselves (i.e., a trend observed on the market). Our research
outcome generated positive feedback from the experts and the mobile payment com-
munity.

The next step of this research would be to use the tool in other context and see
if the evaluation is comparable to the one presented in this paper. Another possible
research is to benchmark the relative performance of our approach against other fore-
casting methods. New modern tools using different paradigms (e.g., prediction mar-
kets (Bruggen et al. 2010) are being deployed in corporate environments to enhance
innovation (Rohrbeck and Gemunden 2011; Rohrbeck 2012).

ABSTRACT 
Context: At the Mission Design and Navigation Software Group 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory we make use of finite exponential 
based  defect  models  to  aid  in  maintenance  planning  and 
management  for  our  widely  used  critical  systems.  However  a 
number of pragmatic issues arise when applying defect models for 
a  post-release  system  in  continuous  use.  These  include:  how  to 
utilize  information  from  problem  reports  rather  than  testing  to 
drive  defect  discovery  and  removal  effort,  practical  model 
calibration,  and  alignment  of  model  assumptions  with  our 
environment.  
Goal: To  show how  we can develop confidence in the practical 
applicability  of  our  models  for  obtaining  stable  maintenance 
funding.  
Method:  We  describe  the  strong  empirical  and  face  validity  we 
have  investigated  for  our  maintenance  defect  discovery  and 
introduction  models.  We  discuss 
the  practical  details  of 
calibration  and  application  within  a  functioning  maintenance 
environment.  
Results: We find that our models, despite their simplicity, appear 
quite valid. 
Conclusions:  The  models  are  useful  in  justifying  and  obtaining 
stable maintenance funding.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The software used for NASA’s deep space missions is critical to 
the success of those missions. For many of these missions, defects 
encountered and not repaired in a timely manner not only inhibit 
operations,  but  may  also  lead  to  the  loss  of  a  billion  dollar

mission.    Despite  our  many  years  of  experience  focusing  on 
quality  development  and  control,  achieving  zero  defects  in  a 
delivered  system  has  evaded  us.  We  accept  that  defects  in 
software  are  not  just  a  possibility  –  they  are  a  certainty.  As  a 
result,  for  every  system 
in  operation  we  must  plan  for 
maintenance  effort  to  find  and  repair  these  inevitable  defects. 
Given our limited budgets and staffing resources, and often a time 
critical need for repair, maintenance effort cannot be planned ad 
hoc.  It  is  simply  too  risky  to  have  a  critical  system  non-
operational  for  an  arbitrary  or  unknown  period  of  time.  Many 
tough  experiences  have  shown  us  that  poor  planning  for 
maintenance increases risk of mission failure.  
Good maintenance planning must address questions of how many 
defects  we  may  encounter,  the  likelihood  of  their  surfacing  at  a 
critical moment, and how long it will take to discover and correct 
them.  These  questions  require  having  credible  and  pragmatic 
maintenance  defect  models.  While  there  are  many  potentially 
useful  models  suggested  in  the  literature,  none  are  widely 
accepted or standard for use in industry [6]. This in part may be 
due to pragmatic demands rather than theoretic concerns such as: 
  Do  the  models  provide  useable  and  useful  information  for 

maintenance planning? 

  Are the models practical to calibrate and use on our projects?  
  Are  the  assumptions  of  the  models  reasonably  valid  and 

validatable relative to our environment? 

The general question is, “Can we have reasonable confidence in 
using the models for maintenance planning for our systems?” So 
while there is a great deal of theoretic study on the derivation and 
effectiveness  of  defect  models,  this  work  aims  to  explore  the 
pragmatic  concerns  indicated  above.  For  example  our  model 
needs differ as described in [7] - the systems are widely-used, and 
under multi-release post-development where we must make use of 
user-reported  defects  (i.e.  problem  reports)  rather  than  test  data. 
For  this  we  have  selected  based  on  principles  suggested  in  the 
maintenance literature ([2][5][6]) models that follow exponential 
decay  (i.e.  finite  exponential).  We  explore  the  face  validity  of 
applying  these  models  to  two  kinds  of  critical  systems  in 
maintenance  at  NASAs  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL).  We 
discuss  how  these  models  provide  a  useful  and  practical 
mechanism  for  understanding  the  accumulation  and  removal  of 
defects 
final-release  systems  as  well  as  how  defect 
accumulation  and  removal  evolves  for  systems  with  planned 
continuous  releases.  We  show  empirically  for  our  two  kinds  of 
systems  that  these  models  are  practical  to  calibrate  and  fit 
remarkably well. Moreover, the models are not merely empirically 
good  fits,  but  have  high  face  validity  and  are  based  on 
assumptions about how defects are distributed and are discovered

We note that that the system use rate is not exactly constant over 
the period in question and there are spikes when people are doing 
parallel  jobs.  The  main  issue  in  satisfying  Assumption  3  is  a 
uniformity of usage and low variance, which is supported by the 
usage data in Figure 1a showing the per day number of users and 
cumulative  users  of  the  legacy  system.  In  terms  of  relatively 
constant system use, for non-operations work, we have accounting 
logs  since  2008  on  our  computing  cluster.  Figure  1b  shows  the 
that from these logs the cumulative runs of the legacy system is 
approximately linear (with obvious “seasonality”) indicating that 
the system general has a more or less constant use rate.  
For assumption 1, consider the operational bugs graph in Figure 2. 
Visually  is  it  apparent  that  the  rate  of  defect  discovery  is 
proportional to the number of operational bugs.  Comparing this 
graph  with  the  code  size  growth  we  see  that  defect  rate  is  also 
proportional to code size. The linear increase in operational bug 
discovery  over  time  is  consistent  (but  does  not  prove)  with 
randomly distributed, uncorrelated defects. This also is consistent 
with the human nature of software development. To contrast this, 
we observe in Figure 2 a non-linear growth in bugs discovered in 
developing Monte (the replacement for the legacy system), which 
are generally regarded as non-random and highly correlated.

To  test  the  defect  decay/accumulation  model,  the  creation  time-
tags of the last 101 defect reports were obtained from the bugzilla 
defect  history  database.  Using  the  defect  from  the  first  of  these 
reports  as  a  reference  time,  a  set  of  time  offsets  for  defect 
discovery  has  been  constructed.  These  offsets  are  from  a 
normalized timeline that removes all non-work hours—evenings, 
holidays  and  weekends  are  all  removed  from  the  time-line.  A 
Microsoft Excel Workbook has been developed for computing the 
best  model  fit  to  the  bugzilla  defect  report  history.    The 
spreadsheet follows the  parameter estimation  method outlined in 
Section 2.1 earlier. Figures 3 and 4 below show the results of this 
fitting  process  for 
in  post-delivery 
maintenance.

In addition to constructing an accumulation model, a decay model 
is  constructed  for  the  observed  defect  history.    Plots  for  these 
models are shown in Figures 5 and 6 below.

Abstract

Background: Classification is the problem of assigning each input object to one of a finite number of classes. This
problem has been extensively studied in machine learning and statistics, and there are numerous applications to
bioinformatics as well as many other fields. Building a multiclass classifier has been a challenge, where the direct
approach of altering the binary classification algorithm to accommodate more than two classes can be
computationally too expensive. Hence the indirect approach of using binary decomposition has been commonly
used, in which retrieving the class posterior probabilities from the set of binary posterior probabilities given by the
individual binary classifiers has been a major issue.
Methods: In this work, we present an extension of a recently introduced probabilistic kernel-based learning
algorithm called the Classification Relevance Units Machine (CRUM) to the multiclass setting to increase its
applicability. The extension is achieved under the error correcting output codes framework. The probabilistic
outputs of the binary CRUMs are preserved using a proposed linear-time decoding algorithm, an alternative to the
generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT) algorithm whose application to large-scale prediction settings is prohibited by its
computational complexity. The resulting classifier is called the Multiclass Relevance Units Machine (McRUM).
Results: The evaluation of McRUM on a variety of real small-scale benchmark datasets shows that our proposed
Naïve decoding algorithm is computationally more efficient than the GBT algorithm while maintaining a similar
level of predictive accuracy. Then a set of experiments on a larger scale dataset for small ncRNA classification have
been conducted with Naïve McRUM and compared with the Gaussian and linear SVM. Although McRUM’s
predictive performance is slightly lower than the Gaussian SVM, the results show that the similar level of true
positive rate can be achieved by sacrificing false positive rate slightly. Furthermore, McRUM is computationally
more efficient than the SVM, which is an important factor for large-scale analysis.
Conclusions: We have proposed McRUM, a multiclass extension of binary CRUM. McRUM with Naïve decoding
algorithm is computationally efficient in run-time and its predictive performance is comparable to the well-known
SVM, showing its potential in solving large-scale multiclass problems in bioinformatics and other fields of study.

Background
The problem of classifying an object to one of a finite
number of classes is a heavily studied problem in machine
learning and statistics. There are numerous applications in
bioinformatics, such as cancer classification using

microarrays [1], prediction of protein localization sites
[2,3], protein fold recognition [4], and identification of the
kinase that acts upon a protein phosphorylation site [5].

Recently, a novel kernel-based learning algorithm called
the Classification Relevance Units Machine (CRUM) for
binary classification was introduced [6]. The CRUM
addresses some of the concerns in the use of the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) [7], including removing the

specification of the error/complexity trade-off parameter
by using empirical Bayes methods, generation of more
parsimonious models, and providing probabilistic outputs
through the estimation of the posterior probability density.
Furthermore, the training algorithm is more efficient than
that of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) [8] that
similarly addressed the SVM concerns. The highly com-
pact model the CRUM generates significantly reduces
the run-time of the prediction system and hence provides
further advantages over the SVM in conducting large-
scale data analyses [9], such as Next Generation Sequen-
cing (NGS) data analysis.

In this paper, we extend the CRUM algorithm into the
more general multiclass setting, allowing for applications
beyond binary classification. This is achieved by decom-
posing the multiclass problem into a set of binary classifi-
cation problems using the error correcting output codes
(ECOC) [10] framework. To preserve the probabilistic out-
puts of the binary CRUM into the multiclass setting, the
algorithm based on the generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT)
model [11] is considered. Since the optimization problem
solved by the GBT algorithm can prohibit its use in large-
scale classification settings, we also propose a simple
linear-time algorithm as an alternative. The details of the
Multiclass Relevance Units Machine (McRUM) construc-
tion based on the binary CRUM are described in the next
section.

In this study, the McRUM is evaluated on two sets of
experiments. First, the McRUM is applied to a variety of
small-scale datasets from the UCI repository [12] in
order to compare the performance of the McRUM under
different settings by using different decompositions of
the multiclass problem into a set of binary classification
problems and the use of two different decoding algo-
rithms that aggregate the binary predictions into multi-
class predictions.

In the second set of experiments, the McRUM is applied
to the problem of classifying small noncoding RNAs
(ncRNAs) to validate the use of the method on a problem
of a larger scale than that of the first set of experiments.
This second set of experiments deal with a three-class
classification problem, specifically, the identification of
sequences from two classes of post-transcriptional gene
regulatory ncRNAs - mature microRNA (miRNA) and
piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) - from other ncRNAs. This
is of interest to small RNA sequencing projects (under
40 nt) where novel miRNAs and piRNAs can be found
amidst a set of unannotated reads. For the miRNAs, it is
especially interesting since the miRNA precursors may not
be sequenced in those small ncRNA sequencing project,
and thus losing the usual avenue of finding novel miRNAs
via identification of their precursors [13]. Furthermore, the
predictions with the McRUM are based solely on the RNA
sequences and no additional genomic information is

required, which is ideal for the study of organisms whose
genomic information is lacking.

The experimental results on datasets taken from the
UCI repository together with the preliminary results on
small ncRNAs show that, under certain settings, the
McRUM can achieve comparable or higher accuracy
than previous analyses of these problems. Thus the
results suggest CRUM’s potential in solving multiclass
problems in bioinformatics and other fields of study.

Methods
Classification relevance units machine
The sparse kernel-based binary classification model
called the Classification Relevance Units Machine
(CRUM) obtains probabilistic predictions [6,9]. Let Ψ to
be a set of objects; e.g. Ψ ⊆ Rd. The CRUM models the
posterior distribution p(C+|x) that an object x Î Ψ is a
member of the positive class C+ using the following
model

P(C+ |x) = σ

(cid:4)
wik(x, ui) + b

(cid:2)(cid:3)M

i=1

(1)

where s is the sigmoid function, M is a positive inte-
ger, k(·,·) is a kernel function, the weights wi Î R, the
bias b Î R, and the Relevance Units (RUs) ui Î Rd.
The posterior of the negative class is then P(C-|x) =
1 - P(C+|x).
For a given k(·,·), M, an observed dataset X = {x1, x2,...,
xN} ⊆ Ψ and the associated class labels {cx1, cx2, ..., cxN
},
the binary CRUM learning algorithm first estimates the
kernel parameter(s) and ui’s through unsupervised learn-
ing, and then learns the values of the wi’s, and b
through an iterative approach. The CRUM learning
algorithm minimizes structural risk under log loss [7,14]
and determines the error/complexity trade-off parameter
using an empirical Bayes method. Further details can be
found in [6,9].

The multiclass classification problem and solutions
Multiclass classification is the generalization of binary
classification to an arbitrary number of classes K > 1.
We denote the set of K classes as T = {C1, C2,..., CK},
and want to learn a classifier function g: Ψ ® T.

There are two major approaches to converting a bin-
ary classifier to a multiclass classifier: the direct
approach and through the aggregation of multiple bin-
ary classifiers.
Direct approach
In the direct approach, the internals of the binary classi-
fier are changed to reflect the K class situation. For
CRUM, this is done by changing the underlying model
from the binary sigmoid model to a multiclass softmax
model,

P(Cj|x) =

(cid:6)

exp

(cid:5)(cid:6)
(cid:5)(cid:6)
M
m=1 wmjk(x, um) + bj

(cid:7)

K
i=1 exp

M
m=1 wmik(x, um) + bi

where the M RUs um, M·K weights wmi, and K biases bi
are to be learned. The RUs can be learned using unsuper-
vised learning on the unlabeled data, as done in the binary
case [9]. The K times increase in parameters lead to a K3
increase in the run-time complexity of the CRUM training
algorithm compared to the binary case, due to the inver-
sion of the (M·K + 1) × (M·K + 1) Hessian matrix. Similar
to the RVM, this may make this method impractical for
large problems [8]. Furthermore, related work in softmax
regression suggests the need for more elaborate and costly
methods for matrix inversion due to ill-conditioning [15].
Likewise, reformulating the SVM for multiclass classi-
fication leads to high cost training algorithms [16].
Therefore the second approach of aggregating multiple
binary classifiers, which we will discuss next, has been
the more popular and practical way to solve the multi-
class classification problem.
Decomposition of a multiclass problem into binary
classification problems
The idea of the aggregation approach is to decompose the
multiclass problem into multiple binary problems that can
then be solved with binary classifiers. The most popular
framework for this approach is the method of error cor-
recting output codes (ECOC) [10]. In this framework, the
decomposition of a K-class problem into L binary pro-
blems is expressed with a coding matrix,

M ∈ {0, 1, }K×L
where each column of M specifies one binary

(3)

classifier.

For example, the one-versus-rest (OVR) matrix for

three classes is a 3 × 3 identity matrix:

(4)

⎞
⎠

⎛
⎝ 1 0 0

0 1 0
0 0 1

matrix:⎛
⎝ 1 1

0  1
 0 0

⎞
⎠

(5)

The Δ symbol denotes omission of the class in the
training of the binary classifier. Therefore in this case,
the first binary classifier is trained with the training data
belonging to class C1 as the positive class set, data from
C2 as the negative class set, and data from C3 is omitted.
The next two binary classifiers are trained in a similar
way. This decomposition is called one-versus-one or all-
pairs (AP) as each binary classifier is trained with only a
single class serving as the positive class and another sin-
gle class as the negative class. Since there are K(K - 1)/2
distinct pairs of classes, the general AP matrix for K
classes is a K × K(K - 1)/2 matrix.

In general any coding matrix M defined by Equation

(3) can be used under the following constraints:

1. All rows and columns are unique
2. No row is solely composed of Δ
3. Each column has at least one 1 and 0

Aggregating the binary outputs
Given a coding matrix M and the outputs of the L bin-
ary classifiers, how do we compute the probability P(Ck|
x)? Let us first consider the simple case of hard decod-
ing, leading to a hard decision. Assume that the binary
classifiers gi, corresponding to the binary classifier speci-
fied by the i-th column of M, return hard decisions
where an output of 1 denotes the positive class and 0
denotes the negative class. Then the collective output of
the binary classifiers on x can be collected into a row
vector g(x) = [g1(x), g2(x),..., gL(x)]. The predicted class
that x belongs to is determined by finding the row of M
with the smallest distance to g(x). Let y, z Î {0, 1, Δ}1 ×
L
. A commonly used measure of distance is a modified
Hamming distance [17]:

the negative class. In general, the OVR matrix for K classes
is the K × K identity matrix.

The all-pairs (AP) matrix for three classes is also a 3 × 3

(2)

There are three columns and thus this decomposition
will require the training of three binary classifiers. The
first binary classifier is trained with the training data
belonging to class C1 as the positive class set and the data
belonging to classes C2 and C3 as the negative class set.
The second binary classifier is trained with the training
data belonging to class C2 as the positive class set and the
data belonging to classes C1 and C3 as the negative set.
The third binary classifier is trained similarly. The name of
this decomposition is called one-versus-rest (OVR)
because each binary classifier is trained with only one class
serving as the positive class and all other classes serving as

Then the predicted class of x is Ck∗. In the case of the
AP coding matrices, this would correspond to choosing
the class with the majority vote of the binary classifiers.
Note that rows of M can be interpreted as the unique
codewords representing the K classes and that the pre-
dicted g(x) is one of those codewords corrupted by
noise. In this context, the above algorithm decodes g(x)
into the closest codeword, thus performing error correc-
tion on the corrupted bits and giving the name of this
approach to classification, ECOC.

Unfortunately, computing the posterior probabilities
pk = P(Ck|x) for all K classes is more difficult. For gen-
eral coding matrices, the Generalized Bradley-Terry
(GBT) model is used to estimate the posterior probabil-
−
ities [11]. Let I+
i denote the set of positive and
negative classes, respectively, used by gi. Then the out-
put gi(x) is the probability of the positive class of the
i-th binary classification problem. Also let Ni denote the
−
number of training data with classes in Ii = I+

We make the naive assumption that the output of
each binary classifier is independent. Under the inter-
pretation of error-correcting codes, the formulation
below is a soft-decoding of the observed g(x) to the
codewords in M under the assumption that bit errors
are independent. Then we can compute the class poster-
iors as simple products of the binary posteriors, as
follows

(14)

where the output of classifiers not trained on data
from class Ck are omitted. For example, from the
decomposition given in Equation (5), P(C2|x, M) = (1 -
g1(x))g3(x). Given the outputs of the binary classifiers,
the algorithm is linear in L. In the implementation log
of Equation (14) is used for computational stability as
shown in Step 4 of Algorithm 2.

The above formulation is a generalization to any valid
M of the Resemblance Model for AP decomposition
proposed in [18]. Again, the key assumption is the inde-
pendence of the L binary classifiers, which is highly
dependent on the decomposition M. Thus in general,
this method is possibly only a crude approximation.

The following pseudocodes summarize the training

and prediction processes of McRUM.

iterative algorithm to solve this optimization.

Note that the optimization of Equation (13) must be
done for every object x that we want to make a prediction
on. This could be too expensive in large-scale prediction
applications. Furthermore, the computational complexity
of the algorithm is not completely characterized. While
Huang et al. [11] provide a proof of convergence under
some assumptions, under a general decomposition the
algorithm may not converge. In the cases that are known
to converge, the speed of convergence is unknown. There-
fore, a naive approach is proposed.

Optimal coding matrix
The next question is whether there is any theory that can
help guide us to designing the optimal coding matrix that
gives the smallest error. There is, but it is not practically
useful. These are some of the properties that would
achieve a good ECOC-based classifier [17]:

1. The minimum distance (using Hamming distance,
Equation (6)) between rows of M should be maximized
2. The number of Δ entries should be minimized
3. The average error of the L binary classifiers
should be minimized

All the criteria are at odds with each other. Consider
OVR decomposition, Equation (4), again. Since all but one
class is considered to be in the negative class, the training
data is likely to be imbalanced. To see why this is a pro-
blem, let us consider an extreme case where 99% of the
training data is negative and only 1% of the data is posi-
tive. Then a binary classifier that always predicts the nega-
tive class would achieve 1% error. Under the framework of
empirical or structural risk minimization, classifier training
would tend to converge to his solution as it provides low
empirical risk under 0-1 loss. Therefore a large imbalance
between the size of the positive and negative sets would
bias the classifier against the smaller class. So while OVR
does not have any Δ entries, the average error of the bin-
ary classifiers could be high.

In the case of the AP decomposition shown in Equation
(5), each individual binary classifier only has a single class
serving as the positive data and another single class ser-
ving as the negative. If the overall training set was
balanced between all K classes, then each of the binary
classifiers will also be balanced and have good average
error. On the other hand, the AP matrix contains many
Δ entries, which is a force that increases error. As a side
effect, each individual binary classifier will be faster to
train compared to OVR, as the amount of data per binary
classifier is reduced. This can be overshadowed by the
sheer number of classifiers to train if K is large.

Therefore knowing which coding matrix is superior to
another a priori is not possible and the choice of coding
matrix M is application-dependent. So we must experi-
mentally try different matrices to find which one is the
best suited to the particular application.

ncRNA dataset preparation and features
The ncRNA dataset is gathered from mirBase’s collection
of miRNA [19], NONCODE 3.0’s collection of piRNA

[20], and the remaining ncRNAs in the NONCODE 3.0
database serve as representatives of other ncRNAs. Each
of these three sets is individually reduced using CD-HIT
[21] to remove sequences with 80% or higher identity.
This helps reduce the evolutionary correlations among
the data and improves the generalization of the CRUM
model that assumes an independent sample. The result-
ing dataset contains 9,439 miRNAs, 81,147 piRNAs, and
94,809 other ncRNAs.

In the gathered data, miRNAs are observed to be 15 ~
33 nt long and piRNAs are observed to be 16 ~ 40 nt
long. For the other ncRNAs, the training and evaluation
of the McRUM does not necessarily use the entire
sequence. We chose to use fragments of length 20 nt,
which is in the overlapping range of the lengths between
miRNAs and piRNAs, so that the fragment has the pos-
sibility of being an miRNA or piRNA had the identity of
the fragment been unknown. If the other ncRNA
sequence is of length longer than 20 nt, we take a ran-
dom fragment of 20 nt from the sequence instead. Due
to the imbalance of the dataset among the three classes,
the training set is a sample of the available data. After
holding out 20% of the miRNA sequences for an inde-
pendent test set, we are left with 7,552 miRNAs in the
training set. Therefore we sample 7,552 piRNAs and
other ncRNAs each to form a balanced 1:1:1 training
set. Together with the hold out of 1,887 miRNAs, the
remaining 73,595 piRNAs and 87,257 other ncRNAs
serve as an independent test set.

Since mature miRNAs and piRNAs lack strong sec-
ondary structures, internally the McRUM represents
each ncRNA using k-mers, for k = 1, 2,..., 5. For each
value of k, the number of occurrences of each type of
k-mer is computed and normalized.

Performance measures
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a
visualization of performance of binary classifiers at var-
ious thresholds. On the x-axis is the false positive rate
(FPR) and on the y-axis is the true positive rate (TPR),
which is also called sensitivity or recall. These two
quantities are calculated as follows,

FPR = FP/(FP + TN)

TPR = TP/(TP + FN)

(15)

(16)

where TP is the number of true positives, FP is the
number of false positives, TN is the number of true
negatives, and FN is the number of false negatives.

For classification of more than two classes, we can com-
pute ROC curves by considering one class as the positive
class and the remaining classes jointly as the negative class.
For the small ncRNA experiment, we have three classes.
For Figures 1(a)) and 2(a), we consider miRNA as the

the Naïve decoding algorithm, and for the Gaussian and linear SVMs with all-pairs decomposition.

positive class, and piRNA and other ncRNAs jointly as the
negative class. Under this setting TP is the count of miR-
NAs correctly classified, while FP is the number of piRNAs
and other ncRNAs classified as miRNAs. FN is the sum of
the number of miRNAs incorrectly classified and the num-
ber of miRNAs unclassified. Lastly, TN is the sum of the
number of piRNA and other ncRNAs correctly classified,
the number of piRNAs incorrectly classified as other
ncRNAs, the number of other ncRNAs incorrectly classi-
fied as piRNA, and the number of piRNAs and other
ncRNAs left unclassified. The piRNAs incorrectly classified
as other ncRNAs, and vice versa, are counted as true nega-
tives because they are correctly classified into the negative
class and not into the positive class, miRNA. Similarly,
Figures 1(b) and 2(b) are computed by considering piRNA
as the positive class and miRNA and other ncRNAs jointly
as the negative class, while Figures 1(c) and 2(c) are com-
puted by considering other ncRNAs as the positive class
and miRNA and piRNA jointly as the negative class.

The timing results for the Naïve and GBT decoding
algorithms in the benchmark experiments were obtained
using MATLAB implementations on a PC with a 2.83
GHz Intel Core 2 Quad processor and 8 GB of memory.

Results and discussion
In this section we present two sets of experiments:
benchmark experiments and small ncRNA experiments.
The purpose of benchmark experiments is to assess per-
formance of McRUM for four different decomposition
settings and the two different decoding algorithms. For
the experiments, we use a group of datasets from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository [12], which is a collec-
tion of databases widely used for empirical analysis of
algorithms in the machine learning community. The per-
formance of McRUM with different settings is presented
in terms of prediction accuracy. The small ncRNA
experiments are conducted to validate the use of
McRUM on a larger scale problem. Through the bench-
mark experiments, Naïve decoding algorithm is proven
to be much more computationally efficient than the GBT
algorithm with its AP and OVR performances being close
to the GBT results. Therefore, in the ncRNA experi-
ments, only the Naïve McRUMs with AP and OVR set-
tings are tested and the ROC analysis is used to illustrate
how the performance of selected McRUM models
changes at various decision thresholds.

For both sets of experiments, we also run the multiclass
SVM implemented in LIBSVM[22] to illustrate McRUM’s
performance relative to SVM-based approaches. The
LIBSVM implementation uses the all-pairs decomposition,
Platt’s method to generate probabilities from the indivi-
dual binary SVMs, and their own algorithm for aggregat-
ing the all-pairs binary results to multiclass posterior

probabilities. The multiclass SVM implementation is freely
available at [23].

Benchmark experiments
For the experiments, we try the McRUM on five small
datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository web-
site [12] using the binary CRUM classifiers with the Gaus-
sian kernel. The kernel width g and model complexity M
is chosen via K-means clustering of the unlabeled training
dataset [9]. For a range of values of M, K-means clustering
is applied to group the unlabeled training dataset into M
clusters and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is
computed by giving the clustering results a probabilistic
interpretation. The number of clusters with the best AIC
value is selected for M. Furthermore, we set g = (2d2)-1,
where d is the maximum distance between cluster centers
obtained by the K-means clustering with K = M. Using
K-means clustering to set parameters as described above
has clear computational advantages, which can be critical
when training is performed on large datasets. The same g
and M are used for all the individual binary classifiers per
dataset.

Throughout the benchmark experiments, we consider
the following decompositions: (i) all-pairs (AP), (ii) one-
versus-rest (OVR), (iii) random dense, and (iv) random
sparse. Random coding matrices M are generated with
and without using Δ symbols for the random sparse and
random dense cases, respectively. For each random type,
100 random M are generated and the M with the smallest
minimum distance among its rows is chosen. Controlling
the number of columns in the random sparse matrix, we
can aim to create a decomposition that is a compromise
between AP and OVR. This is useful should the number
of classes K be large and AP impractical, while still retain-
ing some of the reduced training set benefits per binary
classifier. The details of the different decompositions are
given in the Methods section.

The class label is assigned based on which class has the
largest posterior probability, as determined by the Naïve
and generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT) decoding algorithms
[11]. Since the GBT algorithm is not guaranteed to con-
verge, a maximum of 1000 iterations of the algorithm is
imposed. We first examine results using cross-validation.
Wine dataset
The three-class wine dataset contains 178 instances
[12,24]. The objective is to determine the origin of the
wines based on 13 physicochemical measurements. The
number of binary classifiers for AP and OVR are both
three and so we set the dense and sparse decomposi-
tions to also use three classifiers. The mean accuracy
and its standard deviation results in Table 1 are com-
puted via 10-fold cross-validation. The AP and OVR
decompositions give nearly the same results regardless

of using the Naïve or GBT algorithms. There is a signifi-
cant reduction in accuracy for the Naïve algorithm for
the random dense and sparse cases, but the GBT results
remain close to the Naïve algorithm’s AP and OVR
performance.

The prediction running-times are also measured for
the AP and OVR decompositions where the Naïve and
GBT algorithms show comparable predictive perfor-
mance. As shown in Table 2, Naïve algorithm achieves a
three orders of magnitude speed-up compared to GBT
algorithm for both AP and OVR decomposition.

We observed the mean accuracies of 99.69% (std = 0.33)
and 98.89% (std = 2.34) from Gaussian SVM for the train-
ing and test set, respectively, which is comparable to the
AP and OVR McRUM results of 99.44% (std = 0.20) and
97.78% (std = 2.87). In addition, the best mean accuracy
reported for a 10-fold cross-validation using a multiclass
RVM for this wine dataset is 96.24% [25], which, consider-
ing the standard deviation, is also comparable to the best
achieved here using the McRUM.

We provide the prediction time only for AP and OVR cases since their
predictive performances are competitive to each other for all benchmark
datasets while the performances for random decompositions are much lower
than the AP and OVR cases with Naïve algorithm. The prediction time is
averaged over 10-fold cross-validation for the first three datasets while it is
estimated once for the last two datasets as their explicit partitioning of
training and test sets were given. Included in the parenthesis is the standard
deviation of the prediction time. (AP: all-pairs, OVR: one-versus-rest)

Iris dataset
Table 3 gives the 10-fold cross-validation results on the
three-class iris dataset, a classic machine learning and
statistics benchmark. The problem is to classify flowers
of three species of the genus Iris based on four physical
measurements from a sample of 150 flowers [12,26]. We
see similar results as earlier, where the Naïve and GBT
accuracies are nearly the same and the performance of
Naïve algorithm drops severely under the random
decompositions. Three binary classifiers are used in all
cases. As for prediction running-times, as shown in
Table 2, there is a three order of magnitude speed-up
with the Naïve compared to the GBT algorithm with
minimal impact to predictive performance, as also seen
with the wine dataset results previously.

The mean accuracies on the training and test set we
observed from Gaussian SVM are 97.85% (std = 0.65)
and 96.67% (std = 3.51). The best mean accuracy
reported for a 10-fold cross-validation using a multiclass
RVM for this iris dataset is 93.87% [25]. Again, both
multiclass SVM and RVM results are comparable to the
best achieved here with McRUM (97.85% (std = 0.82)
and 96.67% (std = 5.67)).
Yeast dataset
Table 4 gives the 10-fold cross-validation for the 10-class
yeast dataset that contains 1,484 proteins. The goal is to
predict the cellular localization site of a protein based on
eight sequence-related measures [2,12]. 18 binary classi-
fiers are used for the random sparse decomposition to
achieve a compromise between AP and OVR. For the ran-
dom dense decomposition, we used 34 classifiers as a sam-
ple of the columns of the “complete dense” decomposition
that contains all possible partitions of the data into posi-
tive and negative classes. Only the mean accuracy on the
test partitions are given, as the dataset is large enough that
computing the accuracy of the training partitions is pro-
hibited by the complexity of the GBT algorithm. The extra
effort of the GBT algorithm is required in the random
decompositions cases where the Naïve results are dismal.
The results for AP and OVR, however, are comparable
between Naïve and GBT.

Test Acc is the mean accuracy on the test dataset. The standard deviation is
shown in the parenthesis. Note that, due to the large dataset size and the
high computational complexity of the GBT algorithm, the mean accuracy on
the training partitions cannot be provided. (AP: all-pairs, OVR: one-versus-rest,
Dense: random dense, Sparse:random sparse)

For this dataset, Gaussian SVM shows 60.85% accu-
racy with standard deviation of 4.08. Best results from
AP McRUM (59.43% (std = 6.27)) and OVR McRUM
(59.51% (std = 4.02) are again comparable to the SVM
results considering the standard deviation. The results
from both McRUM and SVM are an improvement over
the 56.5% achieved in the dataset’s original analysis
using PSORT [2] and are comparable to the 59.51%
(standard deviation of 5.49) obtained by k-NN with
PSORT II on this yeast dataset [3].

The prediction running-times in Table 2 show five
orders of magnitude speed-up for the AP and OVR
McRUMs using the Naïve algorithm over the GBT algo-
rithm. This very significant speed-up is achieved with
minimal impact to the predictive performance, as dis-
cussed above.
Thyroid disease dataset
The results in Table 5 are from the three-class thyroid
dataset that has 3,772 and 3,428 training and testing
instances, respectively. The problem is to determine if a
patient has hypothyroid based on 21 attributes [12,27,28].
The number of binary classifiers for AP and OVR are both
three and so we set the dense and sparse decompositions
to also use three classifiers. Regardless of the posterior
decoding algorithm, the AP decomposition performs with
the best accuracy. The Naïve and GBT algorithms perform
similarly on all but the sparse decomposition. It appears
the independent binary classifiers assumption fails in the

sparse case and the Naïve algorithm does not approximate
the posteriors for class 2 and 3 as well as the GBT algo-
rithm does. The SVM results we obtained for this dataset
are 96.29% and 94.37% for training and test accuracy,
respectively. The AP results from the McRUM (98.44%
and 97.22%) are slightly better.

As shown in Table 2, under the AP decomposition, it
takes about 0.132 seconds to compute the predictions for
the entire test set using the Naïve algorithm. On the other
hand, with a maximum of 1,000 iterations per datapoint,
the GBT algorithm takes about 934.693 seconds, almost
four orders of magnitude longer than the Naïve algorithm
for nearly the same predictive accuracy. In the case of
OVR, the predictions times for the test set are 0.124 and
179.427 seconds for Naïve and GBT algorithms, respec-
tively. The OVR decomposition appears to be an easier
problem for the GBT algorithm to solve than the AP
decomposition despite using the same number of binary
classifiers.
Landsat satellite (statlog) dataset
Table 6 gives the results on a satellite image (statlog) data-
set that has six classes with 4,435 and 2,000 training and
testing instances, respectively. The goal is to interpret a
scene based on 36 multi-spectral values [12,27]. Here for
both training and test accuracy, both the AP and OVR
under Naïve and GBT decoding perform at about the
same level. OVR uses 6 binary classifiers, while AP uses
15. To strike a halfway point between the two, the random
decompositions use 10 binary classifiers. However, for
these random decompositions, the Naïve algorithm is out-
performed by GBT. The SVM results we obtained for this
dataset are 98.35% and 91.50% for training and test accu-
racy, respectively. For training set, SVM is superior to AP
and OVR McRUMs (89.85% and 89.76%) and both
McRUMs’ performance on test set (88.05% and 87.70%) is
also slightly worse than the SVM.

Table 2 shows that, for the test set, it takes about 0.240
and 10,612.598 seconds for the Naïve and GBT algorithms
to compute the predictions under the AP decomposition,
respectively. For the OVR decomposition, the prediction

times are 0.139 and 2,816.633 seconds for Naïve and GBT
algorithms, respectively. Again the OVR is the faster of the
two decompositions, partly because of the reduced num-
ber of binary classifiers.

Small ncRNA experiments
To validate the McRUM on a larger scale problem and to
explore its use for the task of NGS data analysis, we
investigated the classification of mature miRNAs and
piRNAs from other ncRNAs. This is a problem of inter-
est in the analysis of small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
data. Further details of the dataset and sequence features
used by the McRUM are given in the Methods section.
For this experiment, two McRUM models are used for
the AP and OVR settings using the Naïve decoding algo-
rithm, and their performance is illustrated relative to the
Gaussian and linear multiclass SVMs.
Cross-validation experiments
Figures 1 through 3 show ROC curves under 3-fold cross-
validation experiments. Note that, because ROC curves
are defined for binary classification, each ROC curve con-
siders one of the three classes as the positive class, while
considering the remaining two classes jointly as the nega-
tive class. For example, Figure 1 considers miRNA as the
positive class and piRNA and other ncRNA as the negative
class. The details of the computation of the ROC curves
are given in the Methods section. The following results are
obtained using the best observed model complexity, M =
600, for the underlying binary CRUM models using the
Gaussian kernel. The kernel width g is chosen using
K-means clustering of the unlabeled training dataset with
the selected M. For multiclass SVM, we trained Gaussian
SVMs and linear SVMs where, on average, about 3,725
support vectors were used in each binary Gaussian SVM
and about 4,048 for each binary linear SVM.

Figure 1 suggests that classifying mature miRNA is a
very difficult problem, as even at the highest observed FPR
(about 0.2), the TPR only approaches 0.6 for both
McRUM and SVM. There is no clear superior decomposi-
tion for McRUM. However, the OVR McRUM occupies a
narrower range of FPRs and cannot achieve as high a TPR
as the AP case. Although both versions of McRUM per-
form slightly better than linear SVM and slightly worse
than Gaussian SVM, the performances are all very similar.
Based on these results and those given below, it is seen
that mature miRNAs often get confused with ncRNAs
other than piRNA.

In contrast to miRNA, Figure 2 suggests that the classi-
fication of piRNA is a much easier problem. The TPR
approaches 0.9 even at a low FPR of 0.09 for McRUM
and 0.5 for Gaussian SVM. The ROC curves for AP and
OVR McRUMs are comparable while Gaussian SVM
shows higher performance and linear SVM works very
poorly. The poor performance of linear SVM may be due

to the non-linear nature of the problem. Although the
Gaussian SVM shows superior performance, both AP
and OVR McRUMs also achieve similar level of TPR by
sacrificing FPR slightly. Furthermore, given more com-
pact models and better computational efficiency of binary
CRUM over SVM [6], McRUM can still be a favorable
choice for large-scale prediction problems.

Finally, Figure 3 shows that discriminating the class con-
sisting of other ncRNAs is also difficult, but not as difficult
as the miRNA case. Again, the performance suffers due to
the difficulty of discriminating miRNA from other
ncRNAs. While linear SVM shows poor performance, in
the region of overlapping FPRs, the ROC curves for Gaus-
sian SVM and both OVR and AP McRUMs are compar-
able. However, the OVR McRUM has a wider FPR range,
allowing it to achieve a high TPR of about 0.8 at an FPR of
about 0.3, that the AP McRUM and Gaussian SVM cannot
obtain.

In Additional file 1, we provide a plot showing the frac-
tion of the validation set left unclassified for the AP and
OVR McRUMs and the Gaussian and linear SVMs at dif-
ferent posterior probability threshold values. In summary,
linear SVM is uniformly worse than the others, AP
McRUM and Gaussian SVM have almost the same frac-
tion of unclassified sequences, and OVR McRUM shows
the smallest number of unclassified sequences across a
wide range of threshold values.
Independent test experiments
Further evaluation of the McRUM and the multiclass
SVMs on a larger, independent dataset was also con-
ducted and the ROC curves are given in Figures 4
through 6. McRUMs are trained with M = 600 and SVMs
are trained with about 5,410 support vectors on average
for each binary Gaussian SVM and about 6,034 for each
binary linear SVM using the entire training dataset used
in the cross-validation experiment. Figure 4 reiterates
that the miRNA case is very difficult, showing results
similar to the cross-validation experiment. For the
piRNA case shown in Figure 5, we again see very good
performance from Gaussian SVM and both the AP and
OVR McRUMs, and extremely poor performance from
linear SVM. Note that the scale of the FPR axis is very
small. As described above, AP and OVR McRUMs can
achieve the similar level of TPR as Gaussian SVM by
sacrificing FPR slightly, about 0.03. In addition, the
McRUMs are computationally more efficient than the
multiclass SVMs since the binary CRUM is less expensive
computationally than the binary SVM [6]. To compute
the class posterior probabilities of the entire test dataset,
the SVMs take about 2.5 to 3 times longer than the
McRUMs even though the SVM implementation is in
faster compiled C++, whereas McRUM is implemented
in MATLAB, a slower interpreted language. (OVR
McRUM takes 3,203.35 sec, AP McRUM 3,429.91 sec,

observed FPR and TPR under varying posterior probability thresholds from 0.30 to 0.99 in increments of 0.01 for the two McRUM models (AP

Gaussian SVM 11,015.29 sec, and linear SVM 8,444.61
sec.) Lastly in Figure 6, we see the remaining ncRNAs
showing good results with Gaussian SVM and the OVR
McRUM that are slightly better than the AP McRUM.

In Additional file 2, we provide a plot showing the
fraction of the test set left unclassified for the AP and
OVR McRUMs and the Gaussian and linear SVMs at
different posterior probability threshold values. The
results are very similar to those obtained for the cross-
validation experiments shown in Additional file 1.

Recently, a Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) based clas-
sifier called piRNApredictior has been proposed for binary
piRNA classification by Zhang et al. [29]. We have down-
loaded the script from their website [30] and trained it
with the training dataset used in [29] (FLD_1) and also
with our own training dataset (FLD_2). Then the resulting
classifiers were evaluated on our test dataset. For the pre-
diction step, both FLD-based classifiers constrain the input
sequence being at least 25 nt. We removed this constraint
in the script as our test dataset contains many ncRNAs
(both piRNAs and non-piRNAs) shorter than 25 nt.

The ROC curves generated from observed results of
the FLD-based classifiers are presented in Figures 7 and
8 along with the ROC curves for McRUM and SVM
results. Both AP and OVR McRUMs and Gaussian SVM

clearly show superior predictive performance over the
FLD-based classifiers. One reason for the lower perfor-
mance of FLD-based classifiers can be the possible non-
linear boundary between the classes of ncRNAs under
the features considered. The nonlinearity of the problem
is also evident from the extremely poor performance of
linear SVM.

Note that about 99% of the sequences in the positive
training dataset for FLD_1 are from NONCODE 2.0’s
collection of piRNA. Our positive test dataset is gath-
ered from a later version of NONCODE database and,
as a result, 98.57% of the sequences in our positive test
dataset are already included in the positive training
dataset used for FLD_1. Therefore the prediction results
may be biased in favor of FLD_1. Then, FLD_2 showing
better performance than FLD_1 may seem contradictory
when the training set used for FLD_2 is independent of
the test set. It can be because FLD_1 is not specifically
trained on the ncRNAs shorter than 25 nt. The training
dataset for FLD_1 contains about 4.67% ncRNAs shorter
than 25 nt while our training dataset used for FLD_2
contains 66.41% sequences shorter than 25 nt. In the
test dataset, 55.93% of the sequences in the test dataset
are shorter than 25 nt, for which correct prediction can
be hard for FLD_1.

Conclusions
In this study, the binary CRUM model is generalized to
the multiclass setting via ECOC framework. The probabil-
istic nature of the binary CRUM is preserved using either
the GBT or the proposed linear-time decoding algorithms.
The proposed linear-time algorithm allows for efficient
application to large-scale prediction settings, where the
GBT algorithm’s complexity is prohibitive, while still
maintaining comparable predictive performance under
certain decompositions of the given multiclass problems,
as evidenced by the benchmark experiments. The applic-
ability of the McRUM to larger scale problems is demon-
strated by an analysis of small ncRNA sequences. The
results demonstrate that McRUM can be an advantageous
solution to resolve multiclass problems especially when
applied to large datasets.

The preliminary results on small ncRNA classification
presented in this paper demonstrate that the McRUM
has potential in addressing the problem of classifying
small ncRNAs. In this study, we restricted the length of
the other ncRNA fragments to be maximum of 20 nt,
but we plan to conduct further experiments with various
lengths of fragments. We also plan to include short
byproducts of small RNA biogenesis, such as miRNA*,
in the class of other ncRNAs. In the future, we will also
extend the current study by including other classes of
small ncRNAs and optimizing the use of the McRUM
for large-scale datasets such as those generated by NGS

sequencing projects. Features other than the simple k-
mers will be considered to improve the predictive per-
formance, especially for classifying the mature miRNAs.
Finally, the interesting preliminary results obtained by
the multiclass Gaussian SVM on the problem of small
ncRNA classification show that it could be an advanta-
geous alternative to McRUM on smaller datasets and
thus we intend to develop in tandem both classifiers for
further experiments. The resulting small ncRNA classi-
fiers will be integrated into a combined prediction tool
that will offer both the multiclass SVM and McRUM
options providing more alternative choices to users.

Abstract

XML and the XPath querying language have become
ubiquitous data and querying standards used in many
industrial settings and across the World-Wide Web. The
high latency of XPath queries over large XML databases
remains a problem for many applications. While this
latency could be reduced by parallel execution, issues
such as work partitioning, memory contention, and
load imbalance may diminish the beneﬁts of paralleliza-
tion. We propose three parallel XPath query engines:
Static Work Partitioning, Work Queue, and Producer-
Consumer-Hybrid. All three engines attempt to solve
the issue of load imbalance while minimizing sequen-
tial execution time and overhead. We analyze their per-
formance on sets of synthetic and real-world datasets.
Results obtained on two multi-core platforms show that
while load-balancing is easily achieved for most syn-
thetic datasets, real-world datasets prove more chal-
lenging. Nevertheless, our Producer-Consumer-Hybrid
query engine achieves good results across the board
(speedup up to 6.31 on an 8-core platform).

Introduction

The increasing number of processing cores on modern
commodity multi-core systems represents an opportu-
nity for reducing the latency of XPath query process-
ing. Most state-of-the-art XPath processing libraries,
such as Apache Xalan [18], leverage multi-core archi-
tectures through the concurrent execution of multiple
XPath queries: multiple threads each evaluating a dif-
ferent XPath query simultaneously. Although the over-
all throughput is increased, there is no improvement in
query latency because each query is executed sequen-
tially. Concurrent evaluation of multiple XPath queries
can actually increase individual query latencies due to
sharing of hardware resources (caches, memory bus).
Previous work on parallel evaluation of XPath queries
on multi-core architectures have used a static partition-
ing of the query evaluation task and a ﬁxed assign-
ment of partitions to cores in order to achieve signiﬁcant
speedups on well-behaved datasets and queries [4, 3].

However, such static approaches are unlikely to work
well when the partitions are unbalanced in the amount
of work they contain.

In this work we study the parallelization of XPath
query evaluation with the goal of reducing the latency
of a single XPath query over an in-memory XML Doc-
ument Object Model (DOM) tree on multi-core archi-
tectures. This work focuses on single-query latency
because, for web-based applications, this latency can
severely degrade performance for end-users. Paralleliza-
tion is achieved by partitioning the query evaluation into
work units, i.e., XML tree nodes that can be evaluated
independently

We investigate three strategies: (i) Static Work Parti-
tion (SWP), (ii) Work Queue (WQ), and (iii) Producer-
Consumer-Hybrid (PCH). SWP is a straightforward ap-
proach used in previous work [4, 3] in which work units
are assigned to threads statically before the onset of con-
current computation. Because it uses static work par-
titioning, SWP can lead to poor load balance if query
processing is more computationally intensive for some
sub-trees than some others. With WQ, work units are
placed in a thread-safe shared workqueue. Threads re-
trieve work units from the workqueue and evaluate them
dynamically, which improves load balance when com-
pared to SWP but comes with additional overhead for
ensuring thread-safety of the workqueue. Both SWP and
WQ correspond to well-known parallelization strategies
that have been used in countless parallelization contexts.
Another such well-known strategy is the producer con-
sumer approach in which threads can either produce
work units into or consume work units from a shared
workqueue. We generalize the producer consumer ap-
proach and develop the PCH strategy in which can also
be a “hybrid”: it can play the role of both consumer and
producer. Given n threads, PCH allows any combina-
tion of p producers, c consumers, and h hybrids, where
p+c+h = n, thus widening the design space compared
to the standard producer consumer approach. This paper
presents the PCH strategy and an empirical study of all
three SWP, WQ, and PCH strategies, making the follow-
ing contributions:
• We implement a custom sequential query engine and

marks, and a real-world XML dataset (DBLP).

an accompanying performance model that serve as
bases for developing parallel query engines and as-
sessing their performance.
• We implement query engines that parallelize the ex-
ecution of a single XPath query on multi-core plat-
forms using the SWP, WQ, and PCH strategies. While
SWP and WQ are standard approaches, PCH is a
novel generalization of the producer consumer model.
• We evaluate our query engines with synthetic bench-
• We ﬁnd that all of our parallel query engines
can achieve some speedup, with PCH achieving
near-linear speedup for most synthetic datasets and
queries, and signiﬁcant speedup for most queries on
real-world and benchmark datasets. The good per-
formance of PCH is explained by the use of hybrid
threads that can be used to improve upon the tradi-
tional producer consumer approach.
• We ﬁnd that some queries over the DBLP dataset are
particularly difﬁcult to parallelize, and we identify the
root causes of poor parallel performance. Some of
these causes can be addressed by modifying our par-
allelization approach. Others are inherent to querying
XML DOM trees and would require modifying the
document order to achieve good parallel speedup.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 describes
our baseline sequential XPath query engine and a simple
performance model. Section 4 details our three parallel
XPath query engines. Their performance is evaluated on
synthetic and real-world datasets in Section 5. Finally,
Section 6 summarizes our results and highlights future
work directions.

2. Related Work

The ﬁeld of XML processing is proliﬁc, with many
studies focusing on both analytic and empirical aspects.
Several areas have been studied extensively and are re-
lated but often orthogonal to our work. The problem of
XML cardinality and selectivity estimation is one such
area [2, 15, 5, 17, 11, 12].
Incorporating estimation
techniques in our methods could yield performance im-
provements, but it is beyond the scope of this paper. An-
other area of XML processing that has been extensively
studied is that of embedded XML processing and hybrid
XML/relational systems. This area has been a hotbed
in recent years (see several broad surveys [7, 8, 14, 1]).
The recent focus has been on comparing and integrating
native XML query processing with embedded XML in
relational systems. The work in [7] compares these two
approaches (and integration), applied to the problem of
twig pattern matching. Our work could also be applied

to pattern matching, but in this paper we only attempt
to leverage multi-core hardware for native XML query
processing. The work in [8] focuses on XED (embedded
databases) versus NED (native databases) and relevant
query optimization techniques. Moro et al. [14] provide
a broader overview of the entire ﬁeld, with discussions
on many topics including query processing, views, and
schema evolution. Schwentick [1] provides a more ana-
lytic study, focusing on automata capable of processing
XML trees efﬁciently. While some of the ideas pertain-
ing to tree processing are relevant for our work, this pa-
per provides a more empirical study of parallel XPath
query execution.

Several authors have studied multi-query process-
ing on XML databases in recent years [16, 19, 6].
These studies aim to improve query throughput on
XML databases by leveraging parallel hardware archi-
tectures. Wang et al. [16] utilize a range of meth-
ods to increase throughput when evaluating multiple
queries over a compressed XML dataset. The work
in [19] incorporates large numbers of queries into a sin-
gle NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata), which is
then fragmented to enable parallelization. Results show
signiﬁcant throughput improvement. Our work differs
because we focus on reducing the latency of a single
query. Cong et al. [6] aim to increase query through-
put as well as reduce query latency. The proposed
approach consists in decomposing XPath queries into
several smaller sub-queries for parallel execution and
then merge query results. The authors describe paral-
lelization methods for XPath queries on both cluster and
multi-core platforms. They obtain signiﬁcant speedup
using all methods, though there are concerns about re-
dundant processing of query nodes. Query decomposi-
tion results in several smaller sub-queries, causing the
possibility of duplicate processing on portions of each
sub-query. Additionally, the process of merging results
of sub-queries can be computationally costly, especially
if there are many query matches. Our approach avoids
these problems by implementing intra-query parallelism
through distribution of XML document tree nodes to
processor cores. The work in [13] improves the perfor-
mance of XML serialization through parallel processing
of XML DOM structures. The authors use work-stealing
to balance work among threads, with region-based query
partitioning to improve scalability. While their approach
successfully achieves parallel speedup, it is limited to
XML serialization. Furthermore, results are only pro-
vided for a single 4-core platform and for one relatively
small (25MB) dataset. Our work aims at parallelization
of general XPath queries on XML DOM tree structures,
with results presented for 4- and 8-core platforms on a
range of synthetic and real-world datasets (up to 1GB in

6223

size).

Some of the work in this paper builds on [3] and [4].
The work in [3] gives an overview of the problem of par-
allelization of XPath queries and presents preliminary
experimental results obtained with the Xalan query en-
gine. The work in [4] compares XPath parallelization
results using three static work partitioning techniques
(data, query, and hybrid partitioning), with arguably lim-
ited success. In this work we extend the work in [3, 4]
by developing and evaluating parallel query engines that
utilize more sophisticated and dynamic work partition-
ing approaches to achieve drastically more efﬁcient par-
allelization.

3. Sequential XPath Query Engine

3.1. Custom Query Engine
Some XPath query engines, such as Apache Xalan, uti-
lize additional indexing data structures to support more
efﬁcient navigation of the XML DOM tree for certain
types of traversals. While this provides improved per-
formance for some queries, it creates unpredictability
when analyzing the overall performance of the query
engines especially in a parallel context. Our initial ex-
periments with the parallelization of Xalan produced in-
consistent results. Table 1 shows parallel query evalu-
ation times in seconds, averaged over 100 trials using
a binary XML tree and a query resulting in every leaf
node being a match node. These results are obtained
on Greenwolf, the 4-core platform described in Table 2.
As explained in more detail in later sections, a simple
approach for parallelizing an XPath query is to ﬁrst use
a sequential phase that traverses the XML tree down to
some predeﬁned depth, which we call the context depth.
This traversal leads to N sub-match nodes at that depth,
and these nodes can then be evaluated in parallel by P
threads on P cores, each thread evaluating N/P nodes.
The context depth is thus a key driver of parallel query
evaluation time. Another such driver is the tag length,
since longer tags imply more time consuming tag com-
parisons. The left-hand side of Table 1 show results ob-
tained with Xalan as the basis for the simple paralleliza-
tion described above. We see that with a context depth
of 2 or 6 the query time is very large above 50 sec or
25 sec, respectively, even though it is below 1 sec for
a context depth of 4. While one may expect that there
would be an optimal context depth, such drastic differ-
ences are difﬁcult to explain. Furthermore, the query
time is not necessarily monotonically increasing with
the tag length. Other results not presented here show
that the query times are not always reproducible. We
conclude that Xalan likely utilizes indexing data struc-

tures that have complex effects on the query time. As a
result, Xalan is not a viable target for this work.

Since our goal is to study the parallelization of XPath
queries on an in-memory DOM tree, and given the re-
sults obtained with Xalan, we opt to develop our own
sequential query engine to form the basis for our paral-
lel query engines. Our custom query engine recursively
traverses the XML document tree, comparing the XML
tag of each traversed node with the XPath query string
of the corresponding depth. If the comparison succeeds,
the nodes’ children are evaluated recursively (recall that
such a node is called a sub-match node). When a node is
found with a tag matching the ﬁnal string of the XPath
query at the query depth, it is saved as a match node.
The right-hand side of Table 1 shows results obtained
for the same parallel query engine as above but using
our custom sequential query engine as a basis instead of
Xalan. The results show stable trends, with increasing
query times as the tag length increase, and comparable
results across different context depths.

3.2. Performance Model
Given an XML tree and an XPath query, our goal is
to derive a closed form formula to estimate the per-
formance of our custom sequential query engine. We
achieve this by averaging attributes of individual nodes
over the entire XML tree and measuring single-node
computation times on the given hardware. The result is
a performance estimate based on the XML tree, XPath
query, and hardware environment. However, due to lim-
ited space, we provide only a brief overview of our se-
quential performance model in this paper. We direct in-
terested readers to [9] for a full derivation and analysis.
In short, the performance model relies on the following

6224

parameters:
• Tree Height (H): The maximum depth of the XML
• Branch Factor (B): The number of children per non-
• Tag Length (L): The number of characters per query
• Query Depth (D ≤ H): The maximum depth of the
• Selectivity (S): The number of (sub-)match children
• τ: The time to compare a single character of a node
tag to a single character of a query tag, so that com-
paring two tags of L characters takes at most τ × L
seconds; and
• α: The time to perform all processing of a single node

per non-leaf node.

query; and

besides tag comparison (e.g., pointer chasing).

Using these parameters and counting the average num-
ber of nodes evaluated, we obtain the following formula
for our sequential performance model:

Tseq = [

B(SD−1 − 1)

S − 1

+ 1] × (τ × L + α).

To enable accurate performance estimation, we execute
several benchmarks to measure α and τ given a partic-
ular hardware platform. More speciﬁcally, we consider
two platforms, Greenwolf and DiRT, described in Ta-
ble 2 and used in dedicated mode for all experiments.
By measuring query execution time on each environ-
ment for a range of synthetic data sets, we empirically
measure τ and α. To conserve space, we omit the details
and direct the reader to [9] for full details. With empir-
ical values for τ and α, we are able to estimate the exe-
cution time of any query using the parameters described
above.

values of the D, B, L, and S parameters. We deﬁne a
notation for our synthetic datasets based on these param-
eters. Each dataset comprises an XML tree and a query
for that tree, and the query depth (D) is equal to the tree
depth (H). We use a Dw Bx Ly Sz notation to describe
the query/tree depth, the branching factor, the tag length,
and the selectivity for a given dataset. For example, D20
B2 L16 S1 denotes a 20-level deep binary tree with 16-
character tags and a 20-level deep query that matches 1
child at each tree node. All generated trees are complete,
and (sub-)match children are selected among a non-leaf
node’s children using a uniform probability distribution.
Each run of a query engine for an experimental scenario
is repeated 100 times. The average is reported and error
bars are displayed on all graphs (often they are so small
that they cannot be seen).

Figure 1 shows the results of one set of experiments
and the corresponding performance estimates on DiRT.
Due to lack of space, we omit further results of the other
experiments, though we ﬁnd that estimates are relatively
accurate (relative error rates under %10) with respect
to actual query evaluation times and they exhibit the
same trends. For this particular experiment, we obtained
an average error of %3.5. We conclude that our cus-
tom query engine performs as expected, that our perfor-
mance model can be used to estimate query evaluation
times, and that our query engine can serve as a viable
baseline for developing parallel query engines.

3.3. Performance Model Validation
In this section we validate both our query engine imple-
mentation and our instantiated performance model by
comparing actual query processing times to analytical
estimates. We perform experiments for a set of syn-
thetic datasets (XML trees and queries), i.e., for various

4. Parallel XPath Query Engines

In this section, we introduce our three parallel XPath
query engines: Static Work Partitioning (SWP), Work
Queue (WQ), and Producer-Consumer-Hybrid (PCH).
SWP and WQ are based on the same two-phase ap-
proached described below, but they differ in how they

Figure 2: Example allocation of work distributed
among 8 threads for each level of a 1024-node XML
tree using SWP.

tree using WQ.

implement the second phase leading to various trade-
offs between load-balance and overhead. All three par-
allel engines use the custom sequential query engine de-
scribed in Section 3.1 as a basis.

A simple approach for parallelizing our sequential
query engine is to use two phases:
• Sequential Phase – Execution of the query to depth
C, the context depth, generating a set of sub-match
nodes. These nodes, which we call the context nodes,
can be evaluated independently.
• Parallel Phase – Parallel evaluation of the context

nodes by N threads on N cores.

4.1. Static Work Partitioning (SWP)
SWP uses a static work distribution. After the sequential
phase, the context nodes are partitioned into N “blocks”
as evenly as possible, and each block is assigned to a
thread for evaluation. Figure 2 shows an example work
distribution across eight cores using SWP on a small
1024-node synthetic dataset (D11 B2 L1 S2, see Sec-
tion 3.3 for details on our synthetic datasets). This ﬁg-
ure is generated from an actual query execution on an
8-core platform during which each node was labelled by
the index of the thread that evaluated it. These nodes
are displayed in the ﬁgure based on their location in the
document tree, and the top C = 6 levels correspond to
the context nodes.

SWP is designed to minimize runtime overhead, and
it can achieve good load-balancing, as seen for instance
in Figure 2. However, several factors can degrade its
performance. First, the sequential context computation
limits overall parallel speedup (Amdahl’s law). Second,
if the context nodes are not evenly divisible by the num-
ber of processor cores, some cores will inevitably have
more work. Third, if some context nodes are more com-
putationally intensive than others (e.g., they have more
children, they have more sub-match children), load bal-
ance will be poor and so will be the parallel speedup. For
these reasons, we view SWP as a baseline approach that
is simple, low-overhead (no shared state among threads

and thus no synchronization necessary), but that is not
expected to achieve high speedup in practice.

4.2. Work Queue (WQ)
WQ employs a simple workqueue to attempt to avoid
load imbalance and improve parallel performance. The
goal is to distribute work among threads more evenly
by dynamically assigning work to idle threads. Once
the context depth C is reached through sequential exe-
cution, the context nodes are divided into W work units
and placed in a shared, i.e., thread-safe, workqueue data
structure. The N threads then begin parallel execution,
each reading a work unit from the queue, processing it,
and returning to the workqueue for more work. Once
the workqueue is empty and all threads ﬁnish, the query
is complete. The use of a shared thread-safe workqueue
increases overhead. Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2 and
shows an example work allocation across 8 threads us-
ing WQ with W = 16 for the same small synthetic
dataset.

Parameters W and C determine the size and the num-
ber of the work units read from the workqueue. Through
empirical testing, we determine that good values of C
and W can be easily found. We ﬁnd that we can achieve
good performance with small values of C and W , but
we omit the details due to limited space and direct in-
terested readers to [9]. For all further experiments with
SWP and WQ, we use C = 3 and W = 16.

4.3. Producer-Consumer-Hybrid (PCH)
PCH extends the well-known producer-consumer model
to evaluate XPath queries in parallel using a novel par-
allel execution model. Unlike SWP and WQ, PCH does
not require a sequential phase to compute context nodes.
Instead, parallel execution can begin as early as possi-
ble (i.e., once the root node has been processed). By
Amdahl’s law we know that reducing the amount of se-
quential computation even by a small amount can lead
to large improvements in speedup. We deﬁne three types

6226

of threads that share a thread-safe workqueue of work
units and can be mixed to achieve various trade-offs be-
tween load imbalance and overhead. An overview of
these thread types and their corresponding activities is:
• Producer – given one tree node, evaluates all children
of this node and writes those children that are sub-
match nodes to the shared workqueue;
• Consumer – reads a tree node from the shared
workqueue,
its children
nodes and add match nodes to the query results, re-
peats; and
• Hybrid – reads a tree node from the shared
workqueue,
its children
nodes, recursing only up to Rdepth times, writes sub-
match nodes back to the shared workqueue and adds
match nodes to the query results, repeats.

recursively evaluates all

The next three sections give details on the algorithms
used by each type of thread above as well as relevant
implementation details.

Producer Threads. Producer threads are designed to
recurse only once given a tree node and write sub-match
nodes to the workqueue so that these nodes can be pro-
cessed by Consumer or Hybrid threads. Consequently,
producer threads never read from the workqueue. One
difﬁculty with this approach is that it is very likely that
a producer threads would become idle early in the query
evaluation process. To address this problem, producer
threads do not write back to the workqueue all of the
sub-match nodes they have identiﬁed. Instead, they keep
a small number of sub-match nodes for themselves. We
use Nkeep to denote this number of sub-match nodes.
These kept nodes are used to continue execution once
all nodes in the set of nodes initially assigned to the
producer have been evaluated. We ﬁnd that any small
value (between 2 and 10) for Nkeep results in good per-
formance. Due to limited space, we omit the details of
this experimentation and direct interested readers to [9].
We utilize Nkeep = 5 for further experimentation.

Our implementation assumes assumes that a “list of
nodes” abstract data type is available, with usual re-
moveFirst, removeFirstN, and append operations to re-
move and return the ﬁrst node from a list, remove the
ﬁrst N nodes of a list and return them as a list, and ap-
pend a node or a list to the end of a list. All operations
on the shared workqueue are enforced to be atomic by
using a single lock. All our implementations use a spin-
lock so as to reduce locking overhead.

Consumer Threads. Like
consumer
threads have limited interaction with the shared
workqueue. While producers never read from the
workqueue, consumers threads never write to the queue.

producers,

They perform a standard tree traversal for whatever
node(s) they are given. Consequently, load-balancing
is achieved solely by the use of producer and/or hybrid
threads. For instance, if a consumer thread happens
to be given the root node of the document tree, it will
evaluate the entire query itself and all other threads will
remain idle. To prevent this worst-case scenario from
occurring, our implementation insures that all producer
and hybrid threads receive work, i.e., nodes to evaluate,
before any consumer thread reads from the workqueue.

Hybrid Threads. Hybrid threads incorporate features
from both consumer, i.e., reading from the shared queue
and recursing, and producers, i.e., writing sub-match
nodes to the shared queue. The Rdepth parameter con-
trols the number of times hybrid threads will recurse be-
fore writing to the shared queue. If Rdepth = 0, hybrids
are producers, although they read when they run out of
work to do. If Rdepth = D, hybrids are consumers and
never write back to the workqueue. Through experimen-
tation we ﬁnd that performance is not greatly impacted
by Rdepth, as long as it is close to D/2. Due to lim-
ited space, we omit the details of these experiments and
utilize D/2 for further experimentation with PCH.

PCH Thread Mix. Due to differences between each
thread type and their potentially complex interactions,
PCH corresponds to a class of query engines. We use
the PCH-p/c/h notation to denote an instance of PCH
with p producer threads, c consumer threads, and h hy-
brid threads (e.g., PCH-3/4/1 would be three producers,
four consumers, and one hybrid). A challenge with PCH
is determining the best mix of producer, consumer, and
hybrid threads. As might be expected, the best mix de-
pends on the dataset, the query, and the hardware.

Figure 4 shows how work is distributed by three dif-
ferent PCH instances on a small 1024-node synthetic
dataset on an 8-core platform. Not surprisingly, the
numbers of producer, consumer, and hybrid threads
greatly affects work distribution. In Figure 4a we see
that load-balancing is poor since only 1 producer thread
(in this case conﬁgured with Nkeep = 1) is available.
The ﬁrst node placed on the work queue requires a large
amount of of work, causing the ﬁrst consumer thread to
be assigned much more work than the other consumers.
Adding a second producer thread, shown in Figure 4b,
greatly improves load-balancing by further partitioning
the work. By adding the second producer thread, we
increase the maximum possible speedup from 2 to 4.
Figure 4c is the most extreme case of work partitioning,
with all 8 threads as hybrids (Rdepth = 0 in this exam-
ple). We see that the entire tree is segmented and threads
all have seemingly random partitions. While such an ex-

ecution provides good load balance, it comes at the price
of high overhead due to constant thread interactions with
the shared workqueue.

5. Parallel Query Engine Evaluation

5.1. Performance Bounds
In Section 3.2 we presented a performance model that
accurately estimates the average execution time of a
given query on a given hardware platform. It uses a se-
ries of data-, query-, and hardware-speciﬁc parameters
and was seen to accurately estimate the performance of
our sequential query engine on a series of synthetic ex-
periments. Using our sequential performance model as a
basis, we can deﬁne a simple estimate of a lower bound
on parallel query execution time, Tbound, as:

Tbound =

Tseq
P

where Tseq is the sequential performance estimate from
Section 3.2, and P is the number of threads/cores. This
lower bound ignores all parallelization overhead and as-
sumes a perfect parallel speedup of P when using P
cores. Tbounds is based on Tseq, and Tseq is only an
estimate of sequential query evaluation time. Therefore,
Tbound is not a lower bound in the theoretical sense of
the term. Nevertheless, our results show that Tbound is
meaningful to assess the absolute performance of our
parallel query engines.

5.2. Validation Experiments
To initially measure the performance of our parallel
query engines, we perform a range of synthetic ex-
periments varying each of our query- and data-speciﬁc
parameters (deﬁned in Section 3.3). We measure the
speedup of each parallel query engine and compare re-
sults with our parallel lower-bounds. Note that the
SWP and WQ engines cannot achieve perfect parallel

thetic experiments. All query engines achieve good

2/1/5).

speedup, as they have a sequential computation phase.
The PCH query engine does not use a sequential phase,
and thus could conceivably achieve linear speedup.

Figure 5 shows one among many sets of (similar) re-
sults for a particular synthetic dataset and query (D4
B100 S100) for varying tag length (L) on DiRT. As ex-
pected all curves grow roughly linearly as L increases.
The results of sequential execution indicate that our
query engine exhibits predictable results, with an aver-
age deviation from the sequential query time estimate of
3.1% for this experiment. Our three parallel query en-
gines achieve good parallel speedup, with a maximum
value for SWP, WQ, and PCH of 4.10, 4.15, and 5.86,
respectively, out of an absolute maximum of 8. We use
PCH-2/1/5 for these experiments, which we found to
perform well for synthetic datasets. Similar results are
obtained for other experiments on both Greenwolf and
DiRT. In all of these experiments PCH achieves signif-
icantly better performance than SWP and WQ, close to
the lower bound estimate.

5.3. Query engine parameters
Each of our parallel query engines has a distinct set of
parameters that deﬁne its behavior. In this section we
present results from experiments used to measure the

impact of these parameters, making it possible to deter-
mine good parameter values for each query engine for a
given dataset/query on a given hardware platform. Due
to limited space, we omit the details of several of these
parameters and direct interested readers to [9] for full
details.

We evaluate the performance of different PCH-p/c/h
instances via a series of experiments with synthetic
datasets. In each experiment we measure average query
execution time using every possible p/c/h combination,
from 1/1/0 to 0/0/N, where N is the number of threads.
We count a hybrid thread as both a producer and con-
sumer, so that PCH-N/N/0 is actually PCH-0/0/N (i.e.,
all threads are both producers and consumers). Figures 6
and 7 show the parallel speedup achieved for each P/C/H
combination on DiRT for two different synthetic exper-
iments. Each experiment has similar tag length and se-
lectivity and corresponds to a document tree with a sim-
ilar number of nodes but with different depth and width
(D13 B4 and D24 B23). In this ﬁgure, all data points
above the anti-diagonal correspond to cases in which at
least one hybrid thread is used (with the upper-right cor-
ner corresponding to an all-hybrid query engine).

We see from Figures 6 and 7 that signiﬁcant paral-
lel speedup is achieved with a range of combinations.
The best parameter conﬁguration is PCH-2/1/5 for both
of these tests. The maximum speedup achieved in Fig-
ures 6 and 7 are 5.69 and 5.62, respectively. In all of our
synthetic experiments, PCH-2/1/5 is never more than
%10 slower than the fastest conﬁguration and performs
better than other conﬁgurations in most cases. We see
similar results with the 4-core Greenwolf environment,
with a maximum speedup using PCH-1/0/3 of 3.06 and
3.13, respectively.

The results, overall, indicate that the load-balancing
beneﬁts of hybrid threads lead to performance improve-
ments when compared to a standard producer-consumer
approach. However, the all-hybrid conﬁguration ex-
hibits poorer performance, indicating that over-utilizing
hybrid threads makes the shared workqueue a bottle-

neck. Note that these experiments are for complete
and balanced trees and queries. We expect that the
best PCH-p/c/h combination may differ for real-world
datasets.

5.4. Experiments on real-world dataset
The DBLP [10] dataset is a 900MB XML ﬁle with
nearly 25 million lines. The structure of the XML ﬁle,
when parsed and loaded into memory, results in a very
shallow (H = 2) tree with widely varying branch fac-
tor. The root node (depth 0) has approximately B = 2.7
million children, yet at the subsequent level the branch
factor is much lower (ranging from B = 5 to B = 100).
The chosen queries we use for DBLP execute in a rea-
sonable time on our multi-core platforms (between 1 and
100 seconds), have various node selection patterns, and
thus lead to a range of performance behaviors. See the
top part of Table 3 for full details on each query.

As in Section 5, we measure the performance for
all possible p/c/h combinations for each query to de-
termine the best combination. Figure 8 shows the par-
allel speedup achieved for Q2dblp for each p/c/h com-
bination on DiRT. The results indicate that, like pre-
vious synthetic experiments, the best conﬁguration for
queries over the DBLP dataset as well is also PCH-2/1/5.
However, the maximum speedup achieved on queries
over DBLP is 3.08, which is much less than previous
synthetic experiments. We see similarly poor parallel
performance for all queries we execute on the DBLP
dataset.

The results of executing six diverse queries over
DBLP are shown in Table 4 and indicate that PCH out-
performs SWP and WQ in all cases. However, we ﬁnd
that while some parallel speedup is achieved, it is much
lower than that seen for synthetic experiments. Fur-
thermore, it is inconsistent across queries. On both
platforms, speedup between 1.92 and 3.11 is achieved
for queries Q2dblp, Q5dblp, and Q6dblp (results shown
in boldface). However, queries Q1dblp, Q3dblp, and
Q4dblp show low parallel speedup (even a slowdown for

Table 4: Average runtimes of six queries over the
DBLP data set on the DiRT and Greenwolf plat-
forms. On three of the queries, speedup is signiﬁ-
cant (shown in boldface), though on the others there
is very little speedup or even slowdown. Details
about each query are given in Table 3.

Q4dblp). We obtain similar parallel speedup on Green-
wolf (4 cores) and on DiRT (8 cores), showing that par-
allel efﬁciency is low.

By examining the shape of the tree, we can deter-
mine if load imbalance is the cause of the poor parallel
speedup. DBLP is a very large, shallow tree with widely
varying numbers of children per node. Table 5 out-
lines some details about the dataset and our six queries.
We see that the root node has a very large number of
children, as expected. For queries Q1dblp, Q3dblp, and
Q4dblp (those that show poor speedup), a very small
number of those children match the query. We postulate

Table 5: Details about the DBLP dataset and queries.
The root node has an enormous number of children
(over 2.7 million). The three queries that lead to
poor parallel performance (Q1dblp, Q3dblp, and Q4dblp)
have a very small number of sub-match nodes. The
high initial branch factor and the low number of sub-
matches contribute to load imbalance.

that this, combined with the small query depth, causes
load imbalance for all of our parallel query engines. Fig-
ure 9 further illustrates the cause of load imbalance.

The large initial branch factor and shallow query
depth combine to cause load imbalance that cannot
be avoided by our query engines. Since all of the
2.7 million nodes at depth 1 are children of the root
node, they must all be processed by a single thread (the
thread to which the root node is assigned, say thread 1).
While processing these nodes, thread 1 writes query sub-
matches to the shared workqueue. Other threads read
these nodes from the workqueue and process their chil-
dren. As Figure 9 shows, however, the small number
of matches and shallow total depth enables these nodes
to be processed quickly, causing other threads to re-
main mostly idle while thread 1 works. This bottleneck
at a single thread is also the reason for the compara-
ble parallel performance between Greenwolf and DiRT
(more cores do not help since they remain idle anyway).

Figure 9: An illustration of what a query over the
DBLP may look like and how work would be dis-
tributed among threads by a parallel query engine
(nodes assigned to a thread are grouped in boxes).
In this example thread 1 has a much larger workload
than the other threads, thus degrading parallel per-
formance.

The three queries on which we do see signiﬁcant paral-
lel speedup (Q2dblp, Q5dblp, and Q6dblp) have a much
higher selectivity, giving the other threads more work
while thread 1 evaluates all 2.7 million nodes.

As expected,

idiosyncrasies of real-world datasets
cause parallel performance degradation. However, de-
spite the extreme shape of the DBLP dataset (2.7 mil-
lion children of the root and a maximum depth of 3),
PCH does achieve some parallel speedup on three of the
queries, thereby outperforming SWP and WQ.

6. Conclusion

In this paper we have evaluated the performance of three
different parallelization approaches that achieve differ-
ent trade-offs between overhead and load imbalance.
The ﬁrst two approaches, SWP and WQ, correspond
to well-known parallel computing techniques, while the
third, PCH, is a generalization of the producer-consumer
paradigm. We have evaluated implementations of paral-
lel XPath query engines that use these three approaches
on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets. Our
results indicate that the addition of Hybrid threads to
the well-known Producer-Consumer paradigm provides
a signiﬁcant improvement, though an all-Hybrid conﬁg-
uration is not ideal. Through experimentation, we found
that the PCH-2/1/5 conﬁguration lead to best overall per-
formance on our 8-core environment (and PCH-1/0/3
using 4 cores). Using this conﬁguration, the PCH query
engine consistently achieves good parallel speedup and
out-performs our other parallel query engines. However,
PCH fails to achieve acceptable parallel performance on
some queries of the DBLP dataset. We have identiﬁed
the cause of this behavior, which is attributed to idiosyn-
cratic features of certain queries on that dataset. Overall,
we expect PCH to lead to good results in the vast major-
ity of practical scenarios.
