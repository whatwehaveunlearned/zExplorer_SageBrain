workflow shown java code ; workflows persisted simple xml format .  appropriate key relations defined schemas ,  data common formats csv regularly lack  metadata .
add metadata , key finding  algorithm ( section ‘ ‘ automated key finding ’’ ) generates  sequence key references statements . 
table transformation  aid creation network models , orion provides  operators manipulating single tables .
remove  operator simply drops column table .
derive  operator allows analysts create new columns  writing user - defined function existing columns . 
orion currently accepts user - defined functions snip-  pets java code dynamically compiled  run - time . 
ranking table rows .
rank operator adds new  column containing rank - ordered integer indices .
rank  statements include sorting criteria :  fields sort ascending descending order .
 sort order determines set nonrepeating indices . 
statements group - fields ; group  rank - ordered separately .
rank operator  create indices enabling nuanced join predi-  cates ( e.g. post_id field scenario sec-  tion ‘ ‘ usage scenario ’’ ) . 
promoting column values node tables .
tabular data  contain implicit linking relationships values  embedded column .
example , single table  research grant awards contain fields princi-  pal investigator ( pi ) , co - pi , institutions  . data , wish form social  networks researchers and/or institutions .
help  model networks explicitly , orion provides  promote operator .
given field names ,  promote operator identifies counts dis-  tinct values columns populates  new table schema ( d , value , count ) .
values  heer perer  123  input table replaced foreign key references  new ‘ ‘ promoted ’’ table .
operation allows  analysts extract implicit node types explicit  node tables .
returning grants example , ana-  lyst promote pi co - pi columns create  new node table people ; original table  serves linking table defining network  people nodes . 
network modeling  core orion language network creation  operators . 
network definition .
given set linking paths  input , link operator extracts network ( edge  table ) according process described section  ‘ ‘ network definition extraction .
’’
input linking  paths starting ending fields .
 multiple linking paths provided , link operator  construct single edge table union  - path edge tables .
resulting table includes  path_id column , indicating linking path gener-  ated link .
optional aggregation parameter  provided , operator generate final edge table  applying aggregate function group -  source target columns ; aggregate values  edge weights . 
link operator accepts optional projection  filtering parameters .
projection parameters consist  node linking table columns include  joins ( included sql select clause ) .
filter  parameters – value pairs table names  predicate functions .
single - table predicates (  filtering node linking tables ) - table  predicates ( join predicates linked tables )  accepted .
link operator accepts boolean para-  meters suppressing self - links unipartite graphs  ensuring distinct edges consid-  ered linking tables .
enforces preaggrega-  tion linking tables . 
subnetwork extraction .
network cre-  ated , orion provides operators extracting sub-  graphs .
example , analyst want compare  time slices evolving network egocentric  networks extracted larger social graph .
fil- 
ter operator creates filtered edge table based set  edge node predicates .
edges removed  node predicate returns false incident node . 
given set ‘ ‘ focus ’’ nodes , subgraph opera-  tor returns subgraph containing edges  specified minimum distance .
orion measures graph 
distance counting hops summing edge weights . 
future , plan support degree - of-  interest extraction method introduced van ham  perer.10  orion provides iterators enable repeated  invocation operator sequence parameter  settings .
iterators useful performing batch oper-  ations , repeated filtering subgraph extrac-  tion .
use iterators implement split operator  segment networks according categorical  numerical fields .
numerical data columns , analysts  choose split network sliding window  ( e.g. create separate time slices network )  anchored window ( e.g. evolution net-  work time ) specifying bounds inter-  est .
iterators enable batch statistics calculation  ( section ‘ ‘ network analysis ’’ ) . 
network aggregation .
times analyst  interested aggregate properties graph  leaf - node details ; given social network ,  wish view aggregate connections genders  cities .
rollup operator aggregates edges accord-  ing specified properties nodes.7,12 rollup  operator generates aggregate edge table node  tables node attributes . 
network analysis  orion additionally provides network analysis algo-  rithms .
stats operator computes sta- 
tistics network stores resulting values  corresponding node edge tables .
statistics  operator modular , allowing user - defined functions  added workflow language .
currently ,  functions written java programming  language conform provided interface defini-  tion .
supported statistics include - degree , - degree ,  betweenness centrality , eigenvector centrality , clustering  coefficient , edge weight asymmetry , edge weight deviance ,  community identification , linkage - based sorting .  metrics common social  network analysis , deserve special mention .
